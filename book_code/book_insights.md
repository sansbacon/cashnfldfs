- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 6 (Oct 12, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-6-4_1a7f9202_2025.html: MY MUST PLAYS * Puka Nacua was up to $8700 here, his highest price of the season. But that was still far too cheap relative to the 2021 Cooper Kupp role Puka is playing. The concerns were some wind in Baltimore and the return of Marlon Humphrey plus Kyle Hamilton. But those were mild docks at most in a cash setting, where Puka’s floor/ceiling combo is outrageous.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 6 (Oct 12, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-6-4_1a7f9202_2025.html: * The last 2v2 I looked at was Chris Olave and Michael Mayer vs. Ladd McConkey and Hunter Long. We had this very tight in projection, with the Olave/Mayer side a hair ahead. In the end, I simply did not want to play Hunter Long. I wasn’t certain he’d be ahead of Johnny Mundt, and thought a zero was in play for Long. So even though I loved Ladd, I took the Olave volume and was happy to play Mayer with Brock Bowers (knee) out again. It’s worth noting that I went off the board a little to play Ladd McConkey on FanDuel (see team above). If I hadn’t done that, I likely would’ve jammed Ladd in on DK. With Quentin Johnston (hamstring) out and a matchup against the Dolphins, I wanted some Ladd in cash. So hedging across sites (one Ladd, one Olave) made sense to me.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 3 (Sep 21, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-3-4_842647f2_2025.html: * Speaking of Seahawks, Jaxon Smith-Ngjiba ’s role this season has been outrageous. And ideal for cash. He’s going to an insane target share weekly, he mixes in short-area targets to keep the aDOT low, and has been going deep more this season. JSN was our top salary-adjusted value in projection . I was not going to be scared off by the illness.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 5 (Oct 7, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-5-3_aea25aa9_2024.html: MY WANT PLAYS * I certainly liked Deebo Samuel and thought he had massive ceiling in this spot. But given Brandon Aiyuk, Jauan Jennings, and George Kittle were all healthy, I had volume/floor concerns. I thought a way to middle that was to simply play Brock Purdy , who was our third-best QB value in projections . Additionally, playing Purdy with Jordan Mason gave me access to (hopefully) all of the 49ers touchdowns. The 49ers implied team total was three points clear of any other team on the slate.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 1 (Sep 9, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-1-2_2a733f11_2024.html: So while I didn’t hate paying up for Josh Allen ($8000) or punting with Justin Fields ($5000), Richardson was clearly the best combo of value and floor/ceiling. He was a “must” for me over Fields because the cap wasn’t very tight. And the Arthur Smith nonsense plus Fields’ woes as a thrower left very little ceiling.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 15 (Dec 17, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-15-2_65fa60fe_2023.html: MY MUST PLAYS * Christian McCaffrey was a whopping $10500, which may have scared some people off. But even at that pricetag, he was still our best salary-adjusted value on the entire slate . As much as I loved Kyren Williams, I was never playing him at $9600 over CMC. The touchdown expectation, floor, pass-game role, natural ability, and offensive scheme all favored McCaffrey. CMC was a lock on DraftKings as well at $9200.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 10 (Nov 12, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-10_446ac3b4_2023.html: Week 10 Results Another week, another close decision that I got wrong. This time it was the 3v3 (described above) that I lost by an unfathomable 32.1 points. And that’s not to just chalk this up to randomness or running bad. These 1v1s, 2v2s and 3v3s that I’ve been getting wrong all season are the entire game in cash. If I can’t get these right, I can’t win.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 4 (Oct 1, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-4-2_fc4b8140_2023.html: O’Connell was a strong value at the $4000 QB floor price, a whopping $2700 less than A-Rich. The quarterback position is one where they all get roughly the same volume as (obviously) they touch the ball on every play. So historically, this was a position I loved to pay down at. Especially when the punt has weapons like Davante/Jakobi/Jacobs and was facing a leaky Chargers defense playing without both Joey Bosa and Derwin James. Of course, the difference in today’s NFL is the emergence of dual-threat QBs who can truly separate from the pack like Richardson. I decided AOC, Russ Wilson, and A-Rich were all roughly similar once salary factored in. So I would let the rest of my team dictate the QB spot.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 3 (Sep 24, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-3-2_166efcd0_2023.html: But I didn’t have the $300 in this lineup and Dell is obviously an extremely explosive player. In the week’s second-best game environment, Dell was a low-floor but high-ceiling option. Which is fine in cash – we need to have players who can win the week for us in the lineup.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 17 (Jan 1, 2023 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-17_6932d3d0_2022.html: * Along those lines, Amon-Ra St. Brown had the same outrageously good matchup as Goff. And while ARSB wasn’t grossly underpriced like Goff was, he did stand out on this slate for cash. St. Brown’s target-earning floor but low aDOT made for an ideal play in this dome spot.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 14 (Dec 11, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-14_7847c1d8_2022.html: MY MUST PLAYS * We had Amon-Ra St. Brown projected for 11.0 targets against a Vikings defense ranked 24th in pass defense DVOA. Even as ARSB’s price has risen to the point he’s now in the Ja’Marr Chase, AJ Brown, Stef Diggs range, I wanted him in this spot. He was in clearly the best game environment on the slate, in a dome, and has the elite floor/ceiling combo we want to for cash.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 12 (Nov 27, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-12_5be72500_2022.html: MY MUST PLAYS * Jeff Wilson was in play as the clear lead back for the Dolphins at $5900 against a Texans defense ranked 31st in rush defense DVOA. When Raheem Mostert (knee) got ruled out, Wilson became a stone cold lock. If you didn’t play Wilson in cash, you need to reevaluate your process.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 9 (Nov 6, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-9_beb78f9f_2022.html: When I do punt at QB like this, I like to do it with running quarterbacks – the floor/ceiling combo is so much higher than the pocket sloths. And if you’ve been paying attention to Justin Fields lately, you know he’s turned a corner with both designed runs and as a thrower. The addition of Chase Claypool for “10-35 snaps” couldn’t hurt. And the Dolphins were really likely to push the Bears out of a run-heavy script. That’s different than Marcus Mariota, who wasn’t a lock to be pushed and even if he was I didn’t trust the Falcons to be aggressive. We had Fields as the third-best QB value on the slate at just $5300.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 8 (Oct 30, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-8_e741c8dd_2022.html: MY MUST PLAYS * Ezekiel Elliott has been cock-blocking Tony Pollard for years. With Zeke (knee) out, Pollard’s backups would be special teamer Malik Davis and borderline NFL player Qadree Ollison. The Cowboys had Brandon Thorn’s No. 1 OL>DL mismatch against the hapless Bears as a 10-point home favorite. Meanwhile, Pollard was just $6100. If you didn’t play Pollard in cash, you need to reevaluate your process immediately.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 4 (Oct 3, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-4_f67c2e2c_2022.html: So while I don’t love paying $8400 for QB in cash, Josh Allen is a unique specimen. The Bills have such an outrageously high pass rate, their pass game is so efficient, and Allen is one of the best goal-line runners in the league. The floor/ceiling combo is outrageous.

## roster_structure

- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 10 (Nov 10, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-10-4_cba6f8ca_2025.html: MY MUST PLAYS * Rico Dowdle was only our No. 3 salary-adjusted value at the RB position . But his price ($6300) made him a “must” for me. In other words, getting off our No. 2 RB Christian McCaffrey ($9000) or No. 1 RB De’Von Achane ($7400) yielded much more viable teams than coming off Dowdle. And I was fine with that given the Panthers’ unrelenting commitment to the run, and their newfound commitment to Dowdle as their true three-down plus goal-line workhorse.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 7 (Oct 19, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-7-4_01bceb8a_2025.html: Olave was easily my favorite, as the Bears came into this game dead last in yards per play allowed and Olave’s underlying metrics remained extremely strong. As noted on Last-Minute Livestream , any weather concerns were already baked into projections – and Olave was our No. 3 WR in salary-adjusted value.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 6 (Oct 15, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-6-2_12c0d3b1_2023.html: * On most slates, Christian Kirk would’ve been more of a “want” than a “must”. But on this slate, the wide receiver pool was quite thin in the low- and mid-range. With Zay Jones (knee) out and an ideal pace/matchup against the Colts, Kirk was the key to the kind of build I wanted to play. We actually had Kirk projected for the exact same amount of points as Calvin Ridley… but Kirk was $1300 cheaper.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 14 (Dec 11, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-14_7847c1d8_2022.html: This was only a 10-game slate, and there weren’t many injury-induced values. It led to a situation where we had to pay down at QB, TE, D. And even then we had to decide between a stone punt at WR or a more balanced build.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 14 (Dec 11, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-14_7847c1d8_2022.html: * I didn’t love the mid-range options at WR. DJ Moore, Jerry Jeudy, Adam Thielen were fine but playing one of them left me with an awkward construction. So I thought it was fine to accept a 0-floor at one of the wideout spots, where we had some viable options. Brandin Cooks and Nico Collins were out, making Phillip Dorsett and Chris Moore starting WRs. Elijah Moore’s role was rising. Kendall Hinton was starting in place of Courtland Sutton. In this build, I only had exactly $3000 to spend. So there was no decision, I had to take a shot on the former first-round pick Philip Dorsett.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 11 (Nov 20, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-11_3cbe3f5b_2022.html: This slate was similar to Week 10 . The double-TE lineups were very viable (if not optimal) once again, but that construction wasn’t nearly as strong this week. That’s because we didn’t have two strong “punts,” we had just one (Dawson Knox). That, along with the usual overpriced WR set and some increases in RB pricing, created a really tight cap yet again.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 10 (Nov 14, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-10-2_41fd70d9_2022.html: That said, Moreau was also extremely solid at just $3200. Darren Waller and Hunter Renfrow both out, and Moreau running a route on roughly 100% of the Derek Carr dropbacks. So it created a unique situation where we had two strong punt tight ends, some very expensive players I wanted to play (see below), and a bunch of “meh” in the mid-range. I give up some ceiling by going tight end in flex, but the floor of something like Moreau vs. Mack Hollins or Marquez Valdes-Scantling isn’t much different.

## position_qb

- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 16 (Dec 22, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-16-3_0d1b3f5b_2025.html: MY MUST PLAYS * This was not a good quarterback slate at all. And given how strong the high-priced studs were, paying down at QB was an absolutely must. The fact that Jacoby Brissett was just $5300 in a home game against the Falcons made it easy. The Cardinals have relentlessly dropped back Brissett at a league-high rate ever since he took over, and 40+ dropbacks in this matchup at this price was a lock. On Fanduel, Bo Nix was only $100 more than Brissett.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 11 (Nov 17, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-11-4_f8a100f7_2025.html: MY WANT PLAYS * I knew I had to punt at QB. I considered JJ McCarthy ($5200), Jacoby Brissett ($4900), and Davis Mills ($4500). McCarthy projected best and I agreed he had the best ceiling due to weaponry, rushing ability, and matchup. But I worried about his floor given what we’ve seen from him this season. So I was fine going down to Brissett, who also allowed me to save a much-needed $300 and projected for a ton more dropbacks here. I was merely trying to get 15 points from QB and move on, given the slate context.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 5 (Oct 7, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-5-4_6bacf558_2025.html: MY WANT PLAYS * I only considered Justin Fields and Justin Herbert at DK quarterback. On FanDuel, Kyler Murray was cheaper than Fields and in play as well. In the end, I liked Fields best given the matchup (our DvP model has the Cowboys inflating QB scoring by a league-high 6.1%) and his truly special rushing ability. * I thought there were five clear-cut elite RBs on this slate: Jonathan Taylor , De’Von Achane, Breece Hall, Rachaad White, Rico Dowdle . I was always playing Achane (see above). So I needed two of the other four. Givem how loose this slate was priced, I wanted to pay up for Jonathan Taylor on both sites. He had no competition for the passing-down role with Tyler Goodson out, and was a threat to play 100% of the snaps against the Raiders.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 13 (Dec 2, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-13-3_a8bf73ad_2024.html: MY WANT PLAYS * I thought Matthew Stafford and Sam Darnold were fine options at quarterback. But I slightly preferred Justin Herbert to them, and he was cheaper. With JK Dobbins (knee) out, I expected a more throw-centric gameplan in a very good spot at Atlanta. Herbert has also shown very good mobility – he came into this game on pace for 69-326-3 rushing line. That’s something Stafford and Darnold don’t have.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 12 (Nov 24, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-12-3_4cb7e148_2024.html: MY WANT PLAYS * It was a weak quarterback slate. I certainly didn’t love Anthony Richardson ’s matchup against the best team in the NFL, but I knew the floor was solid. Richardson’s return to the saddle in Week 11 yielded an absurd amount of RPOs and designed runs, and this game was in the dome in a spot the Colts would have to be aggressive offensively. Despite all of A-Rich’s struggles this season, he still came into the week 6th in fantasy points per QB dropbacks. So at just $5600, a floor of 10 DK points in a spot A-Rich could hit a ceiling was fine by me.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 11 (Nov 17, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-11-3_a86ffd69_2024.html: * I had a Brock Purdy/Davis Allen team in for a bit. But once George Kittle was out and we reduced our Purdy projection , Jameis Winston was clearly ahead in salary-based value. And you don’t have to ask me twice to bet on Jameis’ hyper-aggressive throwing against a decimated Saints defense in the dome with Marshon Lattimore gone. You also don’t have to ask me twice to play cheap QB in cash, and Jameis was just $5500 – $1100 less than Purdy.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 3 (Sep 23, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-3-3_bb4b1713_2024.html: * I thought four quarterbacks were options: Jalen Hurts ($7300), Kyler Murray ($6900), Derek Carr ($5800) and Geno Smith ($5600). In today’s NFL climate of 2-high safeties, light defenses, and run-based playcalling, I do think we need to be careful about QB spends. But the pricing reflected this – Kyler Murray’s dual-threat ability was only $1100 more than pocket-passing Carr. So I thought getting to Kyler or Hurts was right, especially if punting at tight end. In this lineup I only had enough for Kyler.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 3 (Sep 23, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-3-3_bb4b1713_2024.html: As for FanDuel, Cam Akers was just $4000 there. That opened up both spends at QB (I went Kyler Murray) and TE (I went Trey McBride). That turned out to be a bad thing as I didn’t need the Zach Charbonnet savings. Still, the Colts D and Rashee Rice made all the difference. I did prefer Colts D over Titans D thanks to coaching (Shane Fraudron against Colts, Matt LaFleur against Titans), offensive line play (Bears are a mess), and projected dropbacks (expected very run-heavy plan from Packers).
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 14 (Dec 10, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-14-2_bd55895c_2023.html: MY WANT PLAYS * Rashee Rice ($5400) was certainly underpriced given the ability he’s shown to earn targets from arguably the greatest QB ever. But he wasn’t a “must” because we know he only rounds a route on 70% of the dropbacks, and because we know the WR target shares in KC are not sticky week-to-week. That said, I did prefer Rice to both Garrett Wilson (rain, Zach Wilson) and Drake London (volume concerns).
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 4 (Oct 1, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-4-2_fc4b8140_2023.html: As for Moss, his backup is borderline NFL player Trey Sermon. I thought Moss was a really good bet for 90%+ of the RB work. However, the difference between him and Kyren Williams (see above) was Richardson. The ultra-mobile QB threatened to both steal goal-line work, and not throw to RB as much.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 3 (Sep 24, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-3-2_166efcd0_2023.html: Note that Smythe was already leading all tight ends in routes run per QB dropback. Once Jaylen Waddle (concussion) was ruled out, saving the money down to $2900 for Smythe was fine by me.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 18 (Jan 8, 2023 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-18_48f2831b_2022.html: * The tight ends I considered were Pat Freiermuth, Hunter Henry, and Albert Okwuegbunam . All three projected to run a route on nearly all of their QB’s dropbacks and all three are excellent in the pass game. In these spots where it’s close, I typically like to play the cheapest guy at tight end. That was Albert O ($2900), who clearly was freed from Nathaniel Hackett’s doghouse and was now facing what I expected to be mostly Chargers backups.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 17 (Jan 1, 2023 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-17_6932d3d0_2022.html: So at tight end, I thought the two best punts were Jelani Woods and Cade Otton . After thinking about it some close to lock, I decided that on full-PPR DraftKings I did prefer Otton. Tom Brady’s pass attempt range is literally 35-50 every week, often with a low-ish aDOT, and there was no threat to Otton running a route on every dropback since Cam Brate was a healthy scratch. Meanwhile, Jelani’s QB was Nick Foles who would be lucky to get to 30 attempts.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 7 (Oct 23, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-7_acb1cbca_2022.html: * Mark Andrews and Travis Kelce were fine plays at tight end. But I’m rarely passing on full-time, reasonably talented tight ends with good QB play in the $2500-$2900 range in cash. This week, we had three of them. Foster Moreau with Darren Waller out, Cade Otton with Cam Brate out, and Greg Dulcich with a strong pass-game role.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 6 (Oct 18, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-6_d0a178f1_2022.html: MY MUST PLAYS * Josh Allen was the only quarterback I seriously considered. The salary cap wasn’t particularly tight, and $8200 is far too cheap for Allen’s floor/ceiling combo anyway. In this huge game at Kansas City, it was also a spot I expected Allen to run more. And the ability of Patrick Mahomes to put points on the board raises Allen’s pass attempt ceiling. The pricing gap down to Tom Brady ($6300) or Geno Smith ($5700) wasn’t nearly enough.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 2 (Sep 19, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-2_489bfeb9_2022.html: That left Johnson vs. Granson. With Michael Pittman and Alec Pierce both out, Granson’s target competition was weaker. But Johnson had the better spot against the Bucs’ pass-funneling defense. Both projected to run a route on an overwhelming amount of their quarterback’s dropbacks. In the end I slightly preferred Granson for chance at a more featured role, but it was a coin flip.

- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 18 (Jan 4, 2026 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-18-4_eabd1d2c_2025.html: * One of the last 1v1s I looked at was Ja’Marr Chase vs. Jahmyr Gibbs . Both were playing for dead teams, but I expected both to play their normal roles. We had them roughly dead even in projection. This is one of those true coin-flip spots, and I decided to go with Gibbs simply for using RB as tiebreaker.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 18 (Jan 4, 2026 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-18-4_eabd1d2c_2025.html: * Another 1v1 was at the $4200 spot. Jaylen Wright , Jaydon Blue, and Juwan Johnson were all in play. I was going to play Blue, but then got scared off by the Phil Mafah activation. Wright vs. Juwan was another really close call. Again, when it’s close I try to lean toward RB. The Dolphins have raved about Wright, and gave him 24 carries when De’Von Achane left early a month ago.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 16 (Dec 22, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-16-3_0d1b3f5b_2025.html: This was a very similar slate to what we’ve had lately on DraftKings. The best plays were the most expensive plays, and there were barely any cheap RB/WR to feel good about. So a lot of our optimals included tight end in flex. I significantly reduced my action for this slate, I don’t think it’s the best setup for the way I like to play. Note: Unless stated otherwise, the discussion below is about DraftKings.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 16 (Dec 22, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-16-3_0d1b3f5b_2025.html: Week 16 Results I actually think the team I played on DraftKings was roughly right. But I got the last 2v2 wrong for the third straight week. In hindsight when it’s close between RB and TE, I have almost always gone RB for my entire DFS career. So it’s a bit frustrating to not land there this time, as the Michael Carter/Courtland Sutton side won by 13.5 points.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 15 (Dec 14, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-15-3_bb0dd5d5_2025.html: * There were zero WRs at $4K and under I wanted to play. But there were a ton of them at tight end. It’s very rare I think double-TE is right in cash, but this was a unique slate where I thought it was. Harold Fannin is clearly one of the best tight ends in football already, and had very little target competition at $4000. Theo Johnson ($3500) and Jaxson Dart have shown real chemistry, and the matchup against the Commanders was ideal. Playing both wasn’t exciting, but it game me access to the WRs and RB I really needed.

That left the Commanders with only Jacory Croskey-Merritt and Jeremy McNichols at RB. At that point, our optimal lineup (best possible team based on our projections) faded both Christian McCaffrey and Jahmyr Gibbs in favor of jamming the three awesome WR plays: Puka, Chase, and Amon-Ra St. Brown. I didn’t love this because McCaffrey is the definition of an ideal cash game play. Especially in a home matchup against the Texans, the floor/ceiling combo is just outrageous. But I did consider playing our optimal because I really hated playing Mitchell Tinsley . I wasn’t even sure his role would sustain, considering how bad he was the last time Tee Higgins was out. But in the end, I couldn’t pull the trigger to get off CMC.

We had some reasonable value at WR, and I thought some people would mess up their RB spots. Note: Unless stated otherwise, the discussion below is about DraftKings.

James Cook ’s pass-game role has been ticking up lately. And this game had a rising total up to 54.5 points. Cook projected to lose work to Ty Johnson in clear passing situations, but that was baked in. The $7800 tag on Cook was far too cheap for this spot.

He certainly was on FD. The DK 4v4 of Allen, Walker, Loveland, Commanders vs. Jayden Daniels, Jacobs, Pitts, Saints was tight — I simply didn’t think Allen would separate far enough from Jayden to accept the downgrades at RB and TE. Mistakes were made.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 13 (Nov 30, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-13-4_36238941_2025.html: * I knew I wanted to play three RBs on this slate. Both TE and WR were a mess. The final RB spot came down to Kimani Vidal or Breece Hall . I liked both a lot at their cost and in these matchups. In the end I simply decided to roll with our projections, which had Breece 1.9 points clear.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 12 (Nov 24, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-12-4_243a596c_2025.html: This was a similar slate to the Week 11 slate . We had to find the money to spend up at tight end, and also had to make a decision (on DK) on whether to prioritize a RB (Jahmyr Gibbs) or a WR (Amon-Ra St. Brown). Note: Unless stated otherwise, the discussion below is about DraftKings.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 12 (Nov 24, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-12-4_243a596c_2025.html: MY MUST PLAYS * I expected a run-heavy gameplan from the Packers for two reasons. First, when you’re facing inept JJ McCarthy it’s unlikely you’ll need to take risks in the pass game. And second, the Vikings’ blitz-heavy style can get run on. Most importantly, we did not expect that gameplan to change just because Josh Jacobs (knee) was out. We were effectively getting Emanuel Wilson in the Jacobs role, but for just $5300. Wilson was our No. 3 salary-adjusted value in RB projections, behind only Jahmyr Gibbs and Chase Brown.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 12 (Nov 24, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-12-4_243a596c_2025.html: * The Giants came into Week 12 ranked 31st against RBs in our DvP data. Jahmyr Gibbs ’ targets per route run also spikes massively with Sam LaPorta (back) off the field. So even though we expected David Montgomery to mix in plenty, that was baked into projection. And Gibbs was our No. 1 salary-adjusted value at RB.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 12 (Nov 24, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-12-4_243a596c_2025.html: Week 12 Results The projections team just continues to smash. We had Gibbs, Emanuel Wilson, and Chase Brown as the clear three to play on both sites. When you get RB right in cash, it makes everything else easy. I actually had this team in as my “dummy” team on Friday, and never changed. A straightforward week, as the best cash season of my life continues.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 11 (Nov 17, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-11-4_f8a100f7_2025.html: * Yes, Jaylen Warren projected to lose the pass-down snaps to Kenneth Gainwell. But when you’re playing the Bengals, it’s still a net win. Our DvP metrics had the Bengals inflating opponent RB scoring by a whopping 12.6%, most in the NFL. So even though I don’t typically like playing Arthur Smith players in cash, the talent/matchup at $6100 was too strong.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 10 (Nov 10, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-10-4_cba6f8ca_2025.html: MY MUST PLAYS * Rico Dowdle was only our No. 3 salary-adjusted value at the RB position . But his price ($6300) made him a “must” for me. In other words, getting off our No. 2 RB Christian McCaffrey ($9000) or No. 1 RB De’Von Achane ($7400) yielded much more viable teams than coming off Dowdle. And I was fine with that given the Panthers’ unrelenting commitment to the run, and their newfound commitment to Dowdle as their true three-down plus goal-line workhorse.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 9 (Nov 2, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-9-4_dccd2f62_2025.html: This was the kind of cash slate I like to play. We had viable punts at QB, extremely strong RB values, and a tight pool of WRs to choose from. Note: Unless stated otherwise, the discussion below is about DraftKings.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 9 (Nov 2, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-9-4_dccd2f62_2025.html: MY MUST PLAYS * If you didn’t play Kyle Monangai in cash, you need to reevaluate your process. With both D’Andre Swift and Roschon Johnson out, Monangai had very little competition for backfield touches. And the Bengals came into the week dead last in our DvP metrics against running backs (by a wide margin). We don’t get chances like this at $4600 very often.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 7 (Oct 19, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-7-4_01bceb8a_2025.html: This was a much different slate than what we’ve played the first six weeks. That’s because the running back position was actually weak, opening up a lot of different viable builds. Note: Unless stated otherwise, the discussion below is about DraftKings.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 6 (Oct 12, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-6-4_1a7f9202_2025.html: This was a similar slate to many we’ve had already this season. There were a slew of incredible running back plays, picking the right three would be a key. There were also viable punts available at QB, TE, and D. Note: Unless stated otherwise, the discussion below is about DraftKings.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 6 (Oct 12, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-6-4_1a7f9202_2025.html: * I thought there were six RBs in play: Rico Dowdle , Rachaad White , Javonte Wiliams , Josh Jacobs, Christian McCaffrey, Jonathan Taylor. I knew I’d be playing three, as usual. Given that I considered Puka and JSN musts (see above), the three cheap values were the easy call. It also made it easy that all three had huge workload projections that included pass-down work. Rico Dowdle was staring at 90%+ of the RB touches against the lowly Cowboys defense. Same for Javonte Williams with Miles Sanders done. And Rachaad White projected to dominate the high-value touches (targets and goal-line) against a very young and leaky 49ers defense.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 5 (Oct 7, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-5-4_6bacf558_2025.html: This was a very loosely priced slate. That’s because we had a fistful of RB injuries, and also no Christian McCaffrey or Puka Nacua. I knew we’d have to prioritize raw points over value. Note: Unless stated otherwise, the discussion below is about DraftKings.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 5 (Oct 7, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-5-4_6bacf558_2025.html: * We had the Panthers inflating RB fantasy scoring by a league-high 8.4% . I also love playing De’Von Achane in cash because he has the absurd pass-catching role to go with game-breaking big-run ability and a workhorse role. Given the matchup and then layering in Tyreek Hill’s absence, Achane was a must for me – even on a very strong RB slate.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 5 (Oct 7, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-5-4_6bacf558_2025.html: Week 5 Results The white hot start to the season continues. Definitely got lucky that Justin Fields ran up so many points in garbage time, and obviously Rico Dowdle’s result was 99th percentile. But I was happy with the way we read the murky ARZ, TB, and CAR RB situations this week and were able to emerge with Rico ahead on Top Plays . Can’t say enough about our projections team, as our projected optimals continue to score around GPP-contention levels.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 3 (Sep 21, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-3-4_842647f2_2025.html: * Christian McCaffrey is the ideal kind of cash RB on full-PPR DraftKings. Anytime his price is reasonable, I’m trying to play the NFL’s best receiving back who also has a workhorse role. That’s especially true in a home game against the Cardinals with Jauan Jennings, George Kittle, and Brandon Aiyuk all out.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 3 (Sep 21, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-3-4_842647f2_2025.html: * I had a pretty big pool of WRs I considered for the WR2 and WR3 spots. The cheapest I was willing to go was was Keenan Allen ($4700) and the most expensive I was willing to go was CeeDee Lamb ($8000). I wanted to handle RB first, and then play what fit best per projections at WR. That turned out to be Keenan and Caleb Williams’ clear WR1, Rome Odunze ($5300).
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 2 (Sep 15, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-2-4_2ae947ca_2025.html: This was a very clean slate. There were no shaky injury spots and no weather. The NFL has also gotten to a point where I’m playing three RBs in cash almost no matter what, especially while the RB pricing remains loose on both sites. And we had a punt TE on DraftKings, setting up for a slate that suited me well. Note: Unless stated otherwise, the discussion below is about DraftKings.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 2 (Sep 15, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-2-4_2ae947ca_2025.html: * My WR pool for cash was pretty big. I was willing to sort other positions first, and see what fit at wideout. Even with cheap QB and cheap TE, I knew expensive WR was going to be impossible given what I wanted to do at RB. So as much as I liked Ja’Marr Chase, CeeDee Lamb, and Puka Nacua as cash options… they weren’t going to work.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 2 (Sep 15, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-2-4_2ae947ca_2025.html: * Getting RB right remains the key to cash. I only had five RBs in my cash pool on DK: McCaffrey, De’Von Achane , Chase Brown , Jonathan Taylor, and James Conner. As noted last week in this space , Achane’s talent/role/usage combo is absurd. He played 33-of-36 snaps with Tua Tagovailoa last week – we simply don’t get workhorses who are as explosive and so strong in pass-game as Achane. It’s CMC-esque. So despite systemic concerns around Miami, they were actually favorites to beat the Patriots, leaving Achane as a comfy click.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 1 (Sep 8, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-1-3_2facc129_2025.html: * Other DraftKings WRs I considered were Ja’Marr Chase, Brian Thomas Jr., Jerry Jeudy, Tetairoa McMillan and Ricky Pearsall. Given my desire to spend at RB and jam London, Chase wasn’t going to work. I didn’t want two Browns, so Jeudy was out. The WR that fit was McMillan, who I was more than happy to click. With Adam Thielen gone and Jalen Coker hurt, McMillan was needed as Bryce Young’s alpha immediately. We don’t often get a chance to play extremely talented WR1s against the Jaguars at $5200.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 1 (Sep 8, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-1-3_2facc129_2025.html: * The RB position was the most important on the slate, as usual. I knew I needed to pick the right three of Christian McCaffrey, Jonathan Taylor , Josh Jacobs, Chase Brown , Alvin Kamara, James Conner, De’Von Achane .
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 1 (Sep 8, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-1-3_2facc129_2025.html: If there were no questions about CMC’s health, he would’ve been a lock. Even with injury docks on in projection, we had CMC as the third-best salary-adjusted RB play on the slate. I would’ve been fine playing him, but the RB position was so deep I didn’t think even a 5-10% risk of aggravation was worth taking on.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 18 (Jan 6, 2025 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-18-3_df597acd_2024.html: MY MUST PLAYS * Playing RBs against the Panthers has been a printing press. They came into Week 18 ranked dead last (by a wide margin) in our DvP model , projecting to inflate opposing RB production by 12% over baseline. Add in that the Falcons were in a must-win spot at home, and I would’ve paid significantly more than $8500 for Bijan Robinson .
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 18 (Jan 6, 2025 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-18-3_df597acd_2024.html: * The mid-range of running back was littered with question marks about motivation, playing time, and talent. However, Michael Carter ’s playing time was not in doubt because James Conner, Trey Benson, and Emari Demercado were all on IR. Carter is the exact kind of cheap RB I like to play – his calling card is as a pass-catcher, but he was going to get a ton of base work here as well.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 17 (Dec 29, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-17-3_9959446c_2024.html: MY MUST PLAYS * It was a perfect storm for Bucky Irving . He was facing the Panthers, easily our best RB matchup in DvP data . Rachaad White also committed a back-breaking fumble in Week 16, leaving upside for Bucky on top of his base workload. And the Bucs had everything to play for as they fought for their playoff lives. Bucky was our top salary-adjusted play (at any position) in projections .
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 16 (Dec 23, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-16-2_28f00192_2024.html: This was my kind of slate on both sites. We had cheap QB options, cheap TE options, and four very strong RB plays. I thought the slate would come down to picking the right three WRs. Note: Unless stated otherwise, the discussion below is about DraftKings.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 16 (Dec 23, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-16-2_28f00192_2024.html: MY MUST PLAYS * Jahmyr Gibbs was priced as if David Montgomery was playing. However Montgomery (knee) was out, allowing Gibbs the full three-down plus goal-line role. We projected Gibbs, a truly freakish talent, for 24.1 DK points – one of our biggest RB projections of the season.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 16 (Dec 23, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-16-2_28f00192_2024.html: MY WANT PLAYS * The last RB spot came down to Chase Brown ($7700) or Chuba Hubbard ($6800). Both were extremely strong plays who projected for 90% or more of the snaps. I looked at what I could get by going down to Chuba, and decided that getting to something like Malik Nabers or a better defense wasn’t worth it. I also knew I was playing Chuba on FanDuel, creating a bit of a hedge across sites.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 14 (Dec 8, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-14-3_b95658ea_2024.html: MY MUST PLAYS * We’ve seen what happens when Kenneth Walker is inactive: Zach Charbonnet becomes a true three-down plus goal-line workhorse. That would’ve been enough to play him at $4800, but the fact that he already had a strong pass-down role (even when Walker is healthy) made it a stone-cold lock. Especially against an Arizona defense which has been better lately, but still came in as the 6th-best RB matchup per our DvP data .
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 14 (Dec 8, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-14-3_b95658ea_2024.html: * Both Christian McCaffrey and Jordan Mason are done. That left Isaac Guerendo as the unquestioned feature back against a run-funneling Bears defense. Guerendo is also a size/speed freak, the 49ers have shown trust in him already this season, and he plays well in the pass game (39 catches in final 26 college games). Kyle Shanahan’s scheme is extremely RB-friendly, and has been for years.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 14 (Dec 8, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-14-3_b95658ea_2024.html: MY WANT PLAYS * I looked at some lineups with Will Levis at quarterback. But once we got all the running back value, that became unnecessary. Although the matchup for Levis was ideal, he’s a bad NFL quarterback in a game with the lowest total on the slate.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 13 (Dec 2, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-13-3_a8bf73ad_2024.html: MY MUST PLAYS * Yes, the Steelers are not an ideal matchup. But since Zack Moss (neck) went down, Chase Brown has handled nearly 100% of the Bengals RB touches. A legit path to 25 touches at just $6200 as a home favorite in a game with a total up at 47.5 is not something I pass on.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 13 (Dec 2, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-13-3_a8bf73ad_2024.html: Given the way this season has gone from a macro perspective, playing three running backs (as I did on FanDuel) was likely right. We certainly had reasonable options for that RB3 spot – Bijan Robinson and Bucky Irvin were both strong plays. I don’t mind losing, but playing bad certainly stings.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 12 (Nov 24, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-12-3_4cb7e148_2024.html: MY MUST PLAYS * Isiah Pacheco (leg) still wasn’t ready to return. That left Kareem Hunt again with the backfield to himself for one of the best possible matchups against the Panthers. Our DvP data had Carolina inflating RB scoring by 14.5% over expectation, 2nd-most in the league. The touchdown expectation for Hunt relative to his meager $5700 salary was massive.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 12 (Nov 24, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-12-3_4cb7e148_2024.html: * De’Von Achane is the ideal DraftKings play. He’s a featured member of the pass game, has shown a goal-line role, and can break the slate on low volume if needed. Achane certainly wasn’t “cheap” at $7500, but once Brock Purdy (shoulder) was ruled out then Achane became my favorite high-end RB for cash. The Patriots came into the slate 21st in yards per play allowed.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 11 (Nov 17, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-11-3_a86ffd69_2024.html: This felt like an old-school week on DraftKings: Jam in the three best running back plays, find a cheap QB/TE, shoot for upside at WR, and pray. I’m not surprised we’ve gotten to this point given the way this season has gone. Almost every good WR is hurt, almost no RBs are hurt, and teams are playing more run-heavy than we’ve seen in recent years. Note: Unless stated otherwise, the discussion below is about DraftKings.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 11 (Nov 17, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-11-3_a86ffd69_2024.html: * De’Von Achane has taken over as the Dolphins’ No. 2 WR, seeing 35 targets in Tua Tagovailoa’s four starts. He’d also iced Raheem Mostert as the primary running back. Now comes a home game against the Raiders at $7200. On full-PPR DraftKings, I was never fading the pass-catching role plus slate-breaking ability in run game.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 11 (Nov 17, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-11-3_a86ffd69_2024.html: * On a looser slate, a $7300 Puka Nacua against the Patriots would have been a priority. But we had to save money at WR here in order to jam in the elite RB plays. It came down to Cedric Tillman ($5300) vs. Jakobi Meyers ($5600) for me. Playing Tillman allowed me to get to the tight end I preferred (see below), and I already had Jakobi on FanDuel.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 10 (Nov 11, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-10-3_2310eb29_2024.html: The good news for this slate is we had a real sub-$4K WR option on DraftKings to open things up. The bad news is that once again, our most important job was to pick the right three RBs. I thought there were seven really strong RB options on DraftKings and six on FanDuel. Note: Unless stated otherwise, the discussion below is about DraftKings.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 10 (Nov 11, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-10-3_2310eb29_2024.html: MY WANT PLAYS * I only considered two quarterbacks for DraftKings cash: Brock Purdy and Justin Herbert. It’s not intuitive, but note that we projected Purdy for more points than Josh Allen here, and just 0.3 behind Jalen Hurts . That’s because Purdy has had a sneaky nice rushing role this season, the matchup against the pass-funneling Bucs was ideal, and the Niners had all their weapons (except Brandon Aiyuk) back as they came out of the bye. So while going down to Herbert and spending that $1300 to upgrade RB or TE was tempting, I really wanted Purdy.

I thought Alvin Kamara vs. Saquon Barkley was a coinflip, so I played Kamara on FD (where he was cheaper) and Saquon on DK. That was a bit of an IKB on projection, where we had Kamara ahead at $200 less. On DraftKings, Aaron Jones was a tier cheaper than the other backs and also fit better in the full-PPR format. I was happy to play him there. On FanDuel, the cheapest non-Ekeler option was JK Dobbins. On DraftKings, I needed one of James Conner ($6500) or D’Andre Swift ($6500) to save enough salary. This was very close, but I considered the offensive systemic risk lower for the Cardinals than the Bears. And the Jets’ strong secondary typically yields run-based gameplans.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 10 (Nov 11, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-10-3_2310eb29_2024.html: Week 10 Results I never felt too comfortable with this slate, especially at RB. So I was fine to hedge across sites by playing three different RBs on each. I don’t like to play multiple cash lineups on the same site as it’s really hard to win with both, but across different sites they can both be very +EV.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 9 (Nov 4, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-9-3_15a92484_2024.html: This was a unique slate because we actually got very impactful and surprising late news. I thought Brian Robinson (hamstring) was good to go, but he was a late scratch leaving Austin Ekeler very much in play… despite yet another loaded RB slate.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 9 (Nov 4, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-9-3_15a92484_2024.html: * Kendre Miller and Jamaal Williams were both out for the Saints run game. Rashid Shaheed and Bub Means were out for the Saints pass game. And Derek Carr was back, and the Saints were playing the Panthers. We had Alvin Kamara projected for an absurd 22.9 points on DraftKings, 1.8 clear of any other RB.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 9 (Nov 4, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-9-3_15a92484_2024.html: MY WANT PLAYS * Before the Brian Robinson news, I looked at lineups with Kyren Williams and De’Von Achane in the flex. I still really liked those guys, but didn’t want to pass on the pure value of Austin Ekeler . It’s typically a bad idea to pass on a $5300 RB thrust into a featured role – as long as that RB is good in the pass game and the offense/QB play is good. The Commanders had a healthy 24.25 implied team total against the Giants.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 7 (Oct 20, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-7-3_f919d58d_2024.html: This was a really tough slate on DraftKings, mainly because the RB prices have started to creep up and there were no real values at WR. That created a situation where we’d again be forced into uncomfortable spots at WR, which is a spot I hate to be in on DraftKings.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 7 (Oct 20, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-7-3_f919d58d_2024.html: I certainly loved Kyren, but the salary cap was tight this week. I didn’t think it was worth coming off of Jayden Daniels just to upgrade from Chuba or Pollard to Kyren. Pollard got a nice bump with Tyjae Spears (hamstring) out, making him a candidate for 95%+ of the Titans RB touches. And Chuba was still a bit too cheap for his three-down plus goal-line role.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 6 (Oct 13, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-6-3_7120002a_2024.html: This was yet another slate on DraftKings where I thought the pool of cash options at RB, WR, and TE pools was very small. So I knew the results would come down to a lot of 2v2s and 3v2s, mostly around different WR/QB/TE options.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 5 (Oct 7, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-5-3_aea25aa9_2024.html: This was a bit of a strange slate as I had a very small pool of players I was considering. On DraftKings, I only really considered five RBs, five WRs, one TE, and one D/ST. But that didn’t mean the slate was easy. It came down to a ton of very difficult 2v2s involving QB, RB, and WR.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 5 (Oct 7, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-5-3_aea25aa9_2024.html: * Jordan Mason continues to run as the unquestioned feature back and goal-line priority with Christian McCaffrey (Achilles) rehabbing. Now he got a home spot against a Cardinals defense inflating opponent running back scoring by a league-high 10.8%, per our DvP metrics . It was a very crowded RB position again, but Mason’s matchup and role made him stand out.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 5 (Oct 7, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-5-3_aea25aa9_2024.html: * The last 2v2 I looked at was Kenneth Walker and Chuba Hubbard vs. Kyren Williams and Dontayvion Wicks. I honestly couldn’t decide on this one, it was extremely close on projection (the 2-RB side was 0.6 ahead in base). This is the kind of spot I talked about a couple weeks ago on the Solo Pod , I want to make a decision and not get too bogged down time-wise on it.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 5 (Oct 7, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-5-3_aea25aa9_2024.html: In this case, I thought leaning into RB in cash given the state of today’s NFL made a little more sense. Especially since I already had Dontayvion Wicks on FanDuel. While Kyren’s volume projection was elite, I considered it similar to Chuba Hubbard’s. And Kenneth Walker was clearly in a very strong spot after looking so healthy Monday night.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 5 (Oct 7, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-5-3_aea25aa9_2024.html: I certainly didn’t love not being able to play Tyrone Tracy or Kyren Williams. I thought both were really strong. But this is the game on DraftKings these days… can’t play all the strong RB plays (this week there were five really strong ones, I thought).
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 4 (Sep 30, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-4-3_35bd5775_2024.html: The key to this slate was figuring out the RB position. I thought there were literally eight viable options on DraftKings, ranging from Cam Akers ($5300) to Saquon Barkley ($8000). Once we decided how much capital to invest at RB, the rest of the team would fall into place.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 4 (Sep 30, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-4-3_35bd5775_2024.html: * I mentioned the RB situation at the top. As I noted during Last Minute Livestream Sunday morning, I decided on full-PPR DraftKings I wanted to use more of my capital at the WR position. That meant jamming Rashee Rice over punt WR options like Tre Tucker and Greg Dortch. It also meant taking the cheap volume at RB. I did prefer Chuba Hubbard to Cam Akers. Given the way Chuba was used in Andy Dalton’s first start, plus the way he’s played for the last two seasons, and the matchup… He was quite solid. I thought Akers was fine, but the Texans had four RBs active and Akers hasn’t played well in the NFL since 2022.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 4 (Sep 30, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-4-3_35bd5775_2024.html: Note that on half-PPR FanDuel, I went with the opposite approach at RB. I played Bijan and Breece there, saving a bit of money at WR instead.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 4 (Sep 30, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-4-3_35bd5775_2024.html: I was happy with my decision to take advantage of the cheap RB volume on DraftKings this week, allowing me to get 62 touches for a combined $17,400. It obviously helped that both Breece Hall and Bijan Robinson underperformed.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 3 (Sep 23, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-3-3_bb4b1713_2024.html: MY WANT PLAYS (DK) * With Kenneth Walker (abdominal) out Week 2, Zach Charbonnet had the best RB usage in the entire NFL. I expected that role to sustain in Week 3 – but this time for a home game against the Tua-less Dolphins. A running back ticketed for 100% of the RB touches, who is excellent in the pass game, as a 4.5-point home favorite, at $6000 is a very clean spot for cash. Charbonnet would’ve been a “must” on a weaker RB slate.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 3 (Sep 23, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-3-3_bb4b1713_2024.html: * Alvin Kamara was close to a must. But the RB position was so insanely strong this week, I thought it was possible to go in other directions. We had Cam Akers ($4700) without Joe Mixon + Dameon Pierce, Saquon Barkley with an absurd role of the Eagles at just $200 more than Kamara, and De’Von Achane ($7000) without Raheem Mostert.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 2 (Sep 16, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-2-3_fab8f145_2024.html: * Kyle Shanahan and the 49ers are going to run one of the NFL’s most efficient run schemes, no matter who the running back is. We saw proof of that Monday night when Jordan Mason got elite usage and shredded a formidable Jets defense. There was no way to pass on Mason at just $5200 with a true workhorse role in these offense.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 2 (Sep 16, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-2-3_fab8f145_2024.html: * Breece Hall wasn’t benefitting from any injury, he was simply mispriced at just $7400. I thought there were outcomes where Hall handled 100% of the RB opportunities with a very RB-friendly QB in Aaron Rodgers. Although the matchup wasn’t necessarily ideal, Hall’s talent + pass-game role + volume was always a lock here.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 2 (Sep 16, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-2-3_fab8f145_2024.html: * My first instinct when I looked at salaries was I wanted to play Rashee Rice ($6700). I expected a ton more layup targets from Mahomes to create a solid floor, and then the YAC for the ceiling. But as the week went on, it became tougher for me to find a fade on Kyren Williams . Avoiding running backs who play 90% of the snaps in RB-friendly schemes in good game environments at just $6800 is not how I like to play cash. So it was painful, but I decided to go Kyren over Rice in flex.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 18 (Jan 7, 2024 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-18-2_131274d6_2023.html: MY MUST PLAYS * The optimal setup on FanDuel (and DraftKings) this week was very clear. We had a ton of strong cheap RB options, and the best WR plays of the week happened to be expensive. I thought anyone who didn’t take the value at RB and play two of the elite WRs was making a mistake.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 18 (Jan 7, 2024 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-18-2_131274d6_2023.html: But they only had three running backs active: Jerome Ford, Kareem Hunt, and Pierre Strong . Ford and Hunt are the top-2 RBs for the playoffs, so I fully expected a monster Strong workload. As a very athletic back with pass-catching ability, he was a lock at near-min $4600.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 18 (Jan 7, 2024 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-18-2_131274d6_2023.html: MY WANT PLAYS * Jordan Mason ($5700) was a “must” for much of the week. But then the Eagles scratched D’Andre Swift, opening up a very cheap Kenny Gainwell ($4900). And the Chiefs decided to go with only CEH and La’Mical Perine at RB.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 16 (Dec 25, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-16_7712239d_2023.html: I preferred the setup on FanDuel this week because there were more ways for my opponents to make mistakes. I thought overpaying at RB or D/ST on FanDuel would put too much pressure on rest of a lineup, and expected plenty of people to do just that.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 16 (Dec 25, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-16_7712239d_2023.html: * Running back was difficult on both sites. I considered all of Rachaad White, Aaron Jones, Bijan Robinson, Ty Chandler, Kenneth Walker, Chuba Hubbard, Devin Singletary. Note that Breece Hall and Jonathan Taylor were very strong on DraftKings, but very expensive on FanDuel.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 16 (Dec 25, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-16_7712239d_2023.html: The running back I liked most was Rachaad White . He has a CMC-esque role and the Jaguars are arguably the best possible matchup for his skillset. I didn’t consider White a must at $7700, but a very strong want. After that I didn’t feel strongly. Everyone had warts. Instead of focusing on specific RBs, I thought it was right to think of the lineups as a whole. And saving the money with the uber-strong volume projections of Devin Singletary and Chuba Hubbard made the most sense. Because it got me off the shaky mid-range WRs like Garrett Wilson and DeAndre Hopkins.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 15 (Dec 17, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-15-2_65fa60fe_2023.html: I again came into this week with an open mind on which site to play cash on. My first instinct was FanDuel as I knew I wouldn’t have to decide between a bunch of dusty WRs. But I also thought the soft-ish RB pricing of CMC/Kyren on DraftKings would set me up well.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 15 (Dec 17, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-15-2_65fa60fe_2023.html: * Regular listeners know how I feel about Ezekiel Elliott ’s game at this point in his career. But I can’t deny that any running back playing 95% of the snaps with an elite pass-game role at $6500 is a strong play. Regardless of opponent or skill level.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 15 (Dec 17, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-15-2_65fa60fe_2023.html: On DraftKings however, we had to choose between one of Zeke or Antonio Gibson. I certainly preferred Gibson’s game, but even with Brian Robinson (hamstring) out I knew the usage would be a bit unpredictable. So I went Zeke there as well, jamming in three of the best RB roles in the league right now (CMC, Kyren, Zeke).
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 14 (Dec 10, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-14-2_bd55895c_2023.html: I came into the week with an open mind on which site to play cash on this week. On Friday, I thought that the setup on DraftKings was better than FanDuel for me. By Saturday night, I regretted that decision immensely. With Derek Carr getting ruled in and Taysom Hill getting in, we had some very tough decisions at RB. There were also some incredibly tight 2v2s and 1v1s.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 14 (Dec 10, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-14-2_bd55895c_2023.html: MY MUST PLAYS * Christian McCaffrey has the NFL’s best RB role and had an elite spot at home against the Seahawks. I would not have scoffed at paying $10,000 for him in this spot on DraftKings. At just $9200, he was an absolute lock. Note that on FanDuel CMC was extremely difficult to fit at a whopping $10,5000.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 14 (Dec 10, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-14-2_bd55895c_2023.html: * Another 2v2 I looked at closely was Alvin Kamara and Drake London vs. Keenan Allen and Clyde Edwards-Helaire . We had the Kamara side slightly ahead in projection. I decided to go with with the CEH/Keenan side mostly because I preferred the other RB options to the other WR options.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 13 (Dec 3, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-13-2_c9cb0c42_2023.html: * The news on Jonathan Taylor’s thumb injury broke after the Week 13 salaries were released. So we had Zack Moss ticketed for 90% or more of the RB touches at just $4600. Given how the Colts have featured RBs in the pass game and at the goal-line under Gardner Minshew, I was never fading Moss. If you didn’t play Moss in cash, you need to reevaluate your process.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 13 (Dec 3, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-13-2_c9cb0c42_2023.html: * Rachaad White has one of the best RB roles in the NFL. He’s excellent in the pass-game, is the goal-line back, is the 2-minute back, and always plays 75% or more of the snaps. And now he was just $6300 for a home game against a Panthers defense allowing 3.2 touchdowns per game (31st in NFL, only Commanders worse). I wasn’t going to overthink Rachaad here.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 12 (Nov 26, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-12-2_727f489a_2023.html: And given Taylor’s raw talent and the upgrade with Gardner Minshew at QB (more RB checkdowns and more goal-line rushing opportunities without Anthony Richardson), the $7500 tag was far too cheap.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 12 (Nov 26, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-12-2_727f489a_2023.html: But there were other RBs I liked: James Conner ($6600), Rachaad White ($7000), D’Andre Swift ($7200). And we know the Chiefs rarely just turn and hand to RB at the goal-line. So while I really liked Pacheco, he was just on the border of “must.”
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 12 (Nov 26, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-12-2_727f489a_2023.html: On FanDuel however, $7000 for a RB whose calling card is pass-catching rather than TDs can’t be a must. I looked at teams that saved the $400 by going down to Conner, and spent another $200 to get D’Andre Swift. But didn’t like any of the teams upgrades/downgrades there, so was more than fine sticking to White.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 11 (Nov 19, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-11-2_9c99421d_2023.html: MY MUST PLAYS * Devin Singletary handled 30-of-30 RB carries in Week 10, as well as 2-of-5 RB targets. In Week 11, he had one of the best possible setups: Dameon Pierce remained out and the Texans were home against the Cardinals’ No. 24 rush defense (per our DvP metrics ). FanDuel has been aggressive pricing these spots up this season, but they didn’t do it here as Singletary was just $6500.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 10 (Nov 12, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-10_446ac3b4_2023.html: * Similarly, I’d be lying if I said I felt good about Tony Pollard . I talked a ton on this Solo Pod about all of Pollard’s issues this season. He isn’t being used as a $7800 player. However, I was willing to make an exception here for the spot. A three-down plus goal-line running back, no matter how bad, is always a good bet to succeed as a 17-point home favorite against the Giants.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 9 (Nov 5, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-9-2_9643345e_2023.html: * I really liked this spot for Bijan Robinson . I expected Jaren Hall to faceplant as the Vikings starting QB, leading to a lot of short fields, touchdown opportunities, and RB touches. He was also very cheap at $7100. Of course it’s uncomfortable playing any Arthur Smith asset in cash as he makes zero attempt to get his best players the football. And maybe I could’ve leaned more into those concerns. But from a talent and spot perspective, I thought Bijan was far too cheap.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 8 (Oct 29, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-8-2_36af805e_2023.html: This slate was defined by awesome RB plays. Jonathan Taylor, Breece Hall, Isiah Pacheco, Tony Pollard and Alvin Kamara were all elite options. Choosing the right three was going to be the key to the slate.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 8 (Oct 29, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-8-2_36af805e_2023.html: MY MUST PLAYS * In the game before the bye, the Jets finally showed they understand Dalvin Cook can’t play anymore. Breece Hall racked up 80%+ of the RB touches. I expected that strong role to be sticky, this time in a matchup against the Giants. So even though the Jets offense under Zach Wilson is obviously concerning, I wasn’t about to pass on Hall’s elite skill set with this kind of usage at just $7200.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 7 (Oct 22, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-7-2_3ec6ec03_2023.html: * Kenneth Walker was very expensive at $8800, the 2nd-most expensive RB on the slate. But with Zach Charbonnet (hamstring) out and a home game against the Cardinals, I was not about to pass on Walker. He’s such a home run threat and we projected 20.2 carries in this spot, the ceiling was outrageous – and that included TDs as the Seahawks came into the game 21st in PROE when in the red zone.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 7 (Oct 22, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-7-2_3ec6ec03_2023.html: MY WANT PLAYS * Obviously Puka Nacua ’s outlook is worse with Cooper Kupp back. But given all the RB injuries, a likely throw-centric gameplan, and the need to get the ball out quick against the Steelers pass rush… I still really liked Puka Nacua in a very tight target tree. Nacua was a reasonable $7300 on FanDuel, a whopping $2400 less than Cooper Kupp and $1900 less than Keenan Allen. Players like Amon-Ra St. Brown, Kupp, and Keenan are tougher fades on DraftKings where reception volume and the 100-yard bonus mean a ton.

But he was my favorite WR in the $6K range, and spending up at RB + down at WR is my preferred strategy on FanDuel.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 6 (Oct 15, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-6-2_12c0d3b1_2023.html: The story of this week was running back. There were at least eight of them on DK I considered for cash, which is extremely rare. On a thinner RB week, I would have just played the injury values (Chuba Hubbard & D’Onta Foreman) and moved on. But there was so much opportunity cost at the position this week, making things difficult.

I didn’t think Mostert would be a 20-25 touch RB even with Achane out, but that doesn’t matter too much when you play for the Dolphins. Mostert was a near-lock for efficiency and touchdown opportunities in a home game against the Panthers. He was around $1000 underpriced.

He’s the exact kind of running back I like to play – true three-down plus goal-line role with competent QB play and a home game against the leaky Cardinals. But the RB position was so absurdly deep on this slate, I would not have blamed anyone for going Alvin Kamara, Travis Etienne, or David Montgomery instead of Kyren.

In addition to David Montgomery (above), I thought Alvin Kamara ($6300), Joe Mixon ($6400), De’Von Achane ($6100), and Breece Ball ($5400) were all in play. I didn’t really consider Bijan Robinson ($7700) due to price and general Arthur Smith fears.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 5 (Oct 8, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-5-2_1447fa3c_2023.html: Achane is not the kind of RB I typically play at $6100 in cash. We had him projected for roughly the same workload as Raheem Mostert. However, this scheme, the Giants matchup and Achane’s natural ability allowed us to really lean into the efficiency here. Even with some conservative-ish inputs, Achane was still our fourth-best RB value. While I thought the floor on Mixon or Kamara was better thanks to straight volume, the ceiling on Achane made me lean his way.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 4 (Oct 1, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-4-2_fc4b8140_2023.html: MY MUST PLAYS * I believed the Rams when they said they wanted to take some work off Kyren Williams . But based on his backups and his recent usage, I thought he was an excellent bet for 90%+ of the RB snaps. When a $6000 RB has that kind of workload, competent QB play, and usage that includes the pass-game and goal-line work… he’s a stone-cold lock.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 3 (Sep 24, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-3-2_166efcd0_2023.html: * The last 1v1 I debated was Christian Kirk vs. Zack Moss . My first instinct was to go Kirk, as Zay Jones (knee) was out and the Texans are an excellent matchup. But after some thought, passing on Moss when he projected for 90%+ of the RB touches in cash struck me as a mistake. Especially when Anthony Richardson (concussion) wasn’t in there to steal goal-line work, and Gardner Minshew projected for a higher RB target rate.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 2 (Sep 19, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-2-2_f6692ae4_2023.html: MY MUST PLAYS * Yes, Tennessee is a very difficult team to run against. They are a massive pass funnel. But outside of Christian McCaffrey, there were no running backs I really wanted to play (at cost) on DraftKings this week. Given that, I thought saving with Josh Kelley at $5000 – just $1000 over the RB salary floor was a must. Obviously Kelley isn’t Austin Ekeler (out, ankle), but he profiled for 13-18 touches with pass-down and goal-line work in a good offense.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 2 (Sep 19, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-2-2_f6692ae4_2023.html: Week 2 Results I consciously chose to not play Jayden Reed because I preferred the constructions that yielded three stud WRs, rather than the ones that paid up at QB or RB. And I wasn’t coming off of Puka Nacua.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 1 (Sep 10, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-1_a52e1275_2023.html: * The running back position was mostly overpriced on DraftKings. Bijan Robinson was a “must” on FanDuel , but he was $8,000 here. Joe Mixon ($6,800), Travis Etienne ($6,900), and Alexander Mattison ($6,500) were other RBs I would have been very interested in at cheaper tags.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 1 (Sep 10, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-1_a52e1275_2023.html: But given the RB pricing compared to the WR pricing on DK this week, I wanted to spend down. And the spot for Raheem Mostert was extremely clean: No Jeff Wilson (I.R./return), no De’Von Achane (healthy scratch), and facing a Chargers defense that dares teams to run in the slate’s best offensive environment. At $5,400, Mostert projected for 11-14 efficient touches including goal-line work.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 1 (Sep 10, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-1_a52e1275_2023.html: * Similarly, the Saints were thinned out at running back. Alvin Kamara (suspension) and Kendre Miller (hamstring) were both out. Given the state of the RB room, I thought Jamaal Williams was likely to handle 90%+ of the RB touches. I don’t think Williams is very good, and it was a bad matchup. So for a brief minute I considered Brian Robinson ($5,100) at the same price in an elite matchup. But I did expect Antonio Gibson to play 30-40% of the snaps, which was too big a projected usage gap to play B-Rob over Jamaal Williams.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 1 (Sep 10, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-1_a52e1275_2023.html: * I can’t consider Tyreek Hill a “must” because I thought Justin Jefferson was a better play, and I ended up not even getting to him. But Tyreek was underpriced here with a healthy Tua Tagovailoa, nothing to speak of for the Dolphins at WR3 or TE1 or pass-catching RB, and the slate’s best game environment. I was always playing at least two of Tyreek, Ja’Marr Chase, and Jefferson given the way the slate set up.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 18 (Jan 8, 2023 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-18_48f2831b_2022.html: This was a unique Week 18. Normally we get some #TeamPreseason guys set up for big roles, such as a Darwin Thompson/Donald Parham situation from a couple years ago. Other times we get clear-cut smashes at RB because the starter is resting. But this year, oddly, my player pool was very small.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 18 (Jan 8, 2023 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-18_48f2831b_2022.html: * I looked at teams which played Jonathan Williams over Najee Harris at the final RB spot. However, I thought there was some chance Jaret Patterson would simply fill the Brian Robinson role and Williams would stick in that Antonio Gibson-esque role. And while that is certainly fine at $4300, the Commanders were facing Dallas’ starting defense with Sam Howell at quarterback.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 18 (Jan 8, 2023 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-18_48f2831b_2022.html: Week 18 Results I am not sure if Jalen Hurts or the gameplan was limited by his injury. But either way Josh Allen turned out to be the right call at quarterback. I also feel good about the 3-RB structure and teh volume I got there. Getting off Pat Freiermuth to save the money there was also correct. Unfortunately, the decision to play into Amari Cooper’s incentives instead of the right play in Garrett Wilson really hurt as Wilson won that matchup by 10 points.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 17 (Jan 1, 2023 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-17_6932d3d0_2022.html: * I thought about Christian McCaffrey vs. Justin Jefferson a bunch. We had CMC ahead in base projection, but Jefferson ahead in ceiling. It was an incredibly close call and in these spots I typically lean RB in cash. But Jefferson’s outrageous ceiling appealed to me. In hindsight, this was perhaps wrong given the RB floors and the matchups.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 15 (Dec 18, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-15_9a34f1b6_2022.html: This was a tough slate as value evaporated quickly. I thought we would get cheap Patriots RB, but then Rhamondre Stevenson (ankle) played. I thought we would get Elijah Moore, but then Mike White (ribs) gave way to Zach Wilson. I thought we would get a strong Patriots WR punt, but then Jakobi Meyers (concussion) got cleared. It left us with another tightish week.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 15 (Dec 18, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-15_9a34f1b6_2022.html: * There were a lot of very strong expensive plays on this slate. I thought the best ones were Derrick Henry, Josh Jacobs, and Ja’Marr Chase . Normally in cash, I lean RB in this spot. However, there were holes to poke in both Henry and Jacobs. Henry was a road dog with offensive line concerns, a spot I don’t like to play him. And Jacobs had a middling matchup plus I was a little worried about his pass-game role thanks to the finger issue. Meanwhile, Ja’Marr Chase ’s volume has been among the best in the league since he returned from injury in Week 13. And I thought this game in Tampa could turn into a shootout.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 15 (Dec 18, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-15_9a34f1b6_2022.html: Week 15 Results I played terribly this week and I deserve to eat my worst week of the season. Justin Herbert over Patrick Mahomes for just $900 less feels bad in hindsight. I should not have been so down on Zach Wilson and just played Elijah Moore over Nelson Agholor – in cash the way Elijah wins is far better. WR Ja’Marr Chase over RB Derrick Henry wasn’t great.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 14 (Dec 11, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-14_7847c1d8_2022.html: * I certainly had some concerns with Samaje Perine stealing more from Joe Mixon than he did prior to Mixon’s concussion. But we baked more Perine into the projection, and Mixon was still our best salary-adjusted value at the running back position. So in the event we were wrong and Mixon had the role he had prior to injury, there was even more upside here in a dream matchup. The Browns are 31st in rush defense DVOA this season.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 12 (Nov 27, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-12_5be72500_2022.html: * Rachaad White was already climbing the depth chart fast, forcing his way into a 50-50 timeshare with Leonard Fournette. Then Fournette (hip) got ruled out. The Bucs have been loathe to use Ke’Shawn Vaughn and Gio Bernard. So we had White as both the primary base back and the pass-down back against the Browns at just $5100. Given White’s pass-catching calling card from college and Tom Brady’s throw rate at RB, this was another stone cold lock.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 12 (Nov 27, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-12_5be72500_2022.html: * The final 2v2 I looked at was Davante Adams and Hayden Hurst vs. Semaje Perine and Mark Andrews. Note that I did think Perine was better than Michael Carter, even after the James Robinson news. Perine already had the pass-down role even when Joe Mixon was healthy, and we know Trayveon Williams/Chris Evans aren’t going to play in base. Even if Perine was stonewalled in the run game, Joe Burrow is an excellent thrower at RB and Perine would have goal-line work.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 11 (Nov 20, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-11_3cbe3f5b_2022.html: This slate was similar to Week 10 . The double-TE lineups were very viable (if not optimal) once again, but that construction wasn’t nearly as strong this week. That’s because we didn’t have two strong “punts,” we had just one (Dawson Knox). That, along with the usual overpriced WR set and some increases in RB pricing, created a really tight cap yet again.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 11 (Nov 20, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-11_3cbe3f5b_2022.html: MY MUST PLAYS * The Khalil Herbert (out, hip) injury mattered a ton. Whereas Trestan Ebner mixed in with Herbert plenty when David Montgomery was out, I suspected the Bears trust Montgomery more than Herbert. So I thought the floor for Montgomery was 75% of the RB touches, and 90% wasn’t out of the question. Given the dome matchup against a Falcons defense ranked 31st in yards per play allowed, the $6100 tag on Montgomery was far too cheap. Although he’s not an explosive player, he’s solid both around the goal-line and in the pass game.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 11 (Nov 20, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-11_3cbe3f5b_2022.html: Week 11 Results This was one of my worst weeks of the season, but I actually am reasonably happy with the team I played. Being low on CeeDee Lamb was right (at least in results here). Kenyan Drake ended up with just 10-of-17 RB carries and flopped. The mid-range WRs that were in play for cash (Terry McLaurin, Cortland Sutton) didn’t do a ton either. So getting six Parris Campbell targets and seven Nico Collins targets at far less money… in hindsight I feel great about that.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 10 (Nov 14, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-10-2_41fd70d9_2022.html: This was a truly unique slate for two key reasons. First, almost all of the best plays (even salary-adjusted) were expensive. And second, the running back pricing was juiced across the board. It set up a slate where I thought it was right to punt one spot, if not more.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 10 (Nov 14, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-10-2_41fd70d9_2022.html: * On a different slate, Donovan Peoples-Jones wouldn’t have been a “must” or even a “want.” But given that I didn’t consider any RB under $6300 in play and needed to spend at least $6500 at QB, we were always going to have to play a thinnish $4k wideout. And I was fine with that because the mid-range of WR was so weak. Clearly the best WR in that cheapish range was DPJ, an every-down WR in a potential shootout who was averaging 6.2 targets per day over his last five.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 10 (Nov 14, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-10-2_41fd70d9_2022.html: I did consider lineups that had both DPJ and Marquez Valdes-Scantling, but that didn’t quite get me where I wanted to be at running back. So I decided for the rare and painful double-TE construction (see below).
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 9 (Nov 6, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-9_beb78f9f_2022.html: This was yet another slate with very little to chew on cheaply at RB or WR. So, like most of the slates we’ve had lately, we were going to have to sacrifice a really good play somewhere. To me, the big decision was whether to sacrifice Josh Allen or Austin Ekeler.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 9 (Nov 6, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-9_beb78f9f_2022.html: MY MUST PLAYS * The Chargers were facing a woeful Atlanta defense ranked 31st in yards per play allowed. Meanwhile, Mike Williams and Keenan Allen were both out. Although the running back position was extremely strong, the floor/ceiling combo of Austin Ekeler in this spot was something I couldn’t live without. He came into the game with an absurd 19.8% target share and 12.0 carries per game. The role is just absurd in terms of high-value touches.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 9 (Nov 6, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-9_beb78f9f_2022.html: * I was always playing three running backs on this slate. And I was going to play Joe Mixon as my third RB. Much like ETN, Mixon was a three-down plus goal-line back in a home game against the Panthers at just $6500. Regardless of what you think of Mixon’s efficiency and talent, 20+ touches (including all goal-line work and a ton of pass-game work ) in this spot at that price is a good play.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 9 (Nov 6, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-9_beb78f9f_2022.html: But once Damien Harris (illness) was ruled out, I certainly preferred Rhamondre Stevenson . I thought there was a good chance Stevenson would handle 90+% of the RB touches, making him a similar play to Mixon but for $300 less. We had Stevenson for 22.0 points and Mixon for 19.3 in projections .
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 9 (Nov 6, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-9_beb78f9f_2022.html: And if I was coming off Allen, I wasn’t doing it halfway. For example, there was no way I would go to a $7400 Kyler – he’s just too close to Allen. I had to save as much as I could at QB to avoid punting a WR spot and still fitting the three RB locks.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 8 (Oct 30, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-8_e741c8dd_2022.html: * Sam Ehlinger wasn’t a “must” in a vacuum. But given the QBs on this slate and their prices, along with the lack of cheap options at RB/WR, Ehlinger for $4000 was a must.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 7 (Oct 23, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-7_acb1cbca_2022.html: * There were a lot of strong running back options on this slate. Josh Jacobs (see above), Kenneth Walker (see below), Joe Mixon, and Leonard Fournette were the top cut for me in DraftKings cash. But with Josh Palmer out and Keenan Allen (hamstring) shaky, I prioritized getting up to Austin Ekeler in full-PPR at $8300. This was an ideal matchup at home against a woeful Seahawks defense in the slate’s best game environment. With the OL and WR injuries, I did not expect Ekeler’s absurd pass-game to slow down. And the touchdown expectation was very high in this matchup. I had to have him at this price with this pass-game role in this matchup.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 7 (Oct 23, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-7_acb1cbca_2022.html: * I really didn’t like any wideouts for cash below $6300 on this slate. But it was clear we were going to have to play one to make the running backs work. So I would have been fine punting with DeAndre Carter ($3700) if Keenan Allen was ruled out. However, there were positive signs on Keenan’s status Sunday morning and I didn’t think Carter was playable if Keenan was active. They both play the slot.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 7 (Oct 23, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-7_acb1cbca_2022.html: Week 7 Results I was really happy with a couple key decisions I made this week. First, understanding slate context and therefore resisting the temptation to pay up for Lamar Jackson at QB. Second, locking onto Austin Ekeler and not budging despite other strong RB plays.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 6 (Oct 18, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-6_d0a178f1_2022.html: We had too many good plays this week. That was especially true at running back, where injuries to James Conner, Rashaad Penny, Cam Akers, Damien Harris, and Jonathan Taylor left us with a ton of options.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 5 (Oct 9, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-5_c6ef5a4e_2022.html: * The feature back role in Tampa’s offense is so incredibly valuable. Tom Brady annually has one of the highest target rates at running backs, and they produce a ton of red-zone runs. So even though Rachaad White played a lot in Week 4, that was in a trailing situation and mostly in the second half. I still thought the workhorse role belonged to Leonard Fournette , and this was an very strong matchup. Similar to Godwin, Lenny was $500-$700 too cheap.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 5 (Oct 9, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-5_c6ef5a4e_2022.html: * This was a really strong week at running back. I thought Breece Hall, Jeff Wilson, Rhamondre Stevenson, Alvin Kamara , Leonard Fournette, Dalvin Cook, and Austin Ekeler were all in play. Of those, the one I thought was the clear best value (outside of Fournette) was Alvin Kamara. This Seahawks defense is very bad and Geno Smith is playing at a top-5 level. The game was in a dome, Kamara had the previous week off to rest his ribs, and Andy Dalton was more likely to check down than Jameis Winston. On top of that, Jarvis Landry and Michael Thomas were both out, opening up even more targets. At just $6600 and in full-PPR scoring, Kamara was clearly very strong. He also aligned with the “balanced with ceiling” build.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 4 (Oct 3, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-4_f67c2e2c_2022.html: MY MUST PLAYS * With David Montgomery (knee/ankle) out, we knew talented Khalil Herbert would handle at least 80% of the RB work. We also knew the Bears would not try to throw the ball. So at $5700 in a plus matchup against the Giants, the three-down plus goal-line skill set of Herbert was a lock.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 3 (Sep 16, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-3_9faa9f95_2022.html: MY MUST PLAYS * Running back was very weak this week. Given the lack of value at QB and WR, we couldn’t get up to guys like Dalvin Cook or Christian McCaffrey. So I was perfectly fine with a $5900 David Montgomery in a home game against the Texans. I expected somewhere between a 2-1 and 3-1 advantage for DMont over Khalil Herbert in snaps/touches. That meant a lot of touches, as the Bears are clearly petrified of letting Justin Fields do anything but hand off.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 3 (Sep 16, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-3_9faa9f95_2022.html: * In Week 2, Leonard Fournette played 58 snaps and Rachaad White played 9. No other Bucs RB got a snap. So even though the Bucs OL/WR injuries meant far less projected efficiency, there was no way I was fading Lenny at $6500 here. It’s just too much work for a three-down plus goal-line back playing with Tom Brady – who loves to target RBs in pass game.

Given how healthy he looked and his unique three-down plus goal-line role, $7300 at home against the Panthers was a lock. There simply aren’t many explosive running backs who get all the early down work, all the pass-down work, and all the goal-line work. Those players are almost always $8500 or more.

There were at least six RBs that I thought were really strong cash plays, and a few more solid ones. In spots like that, I try not to spend all the way up unless the spots are pristine.

Given that and the improved offensive line, Mixon’s offensive environment plus talent plus role was elite – especially at $7200.

If you’re a subscriber, you hopefully read Top Plays on Sunday morning. I added a note there as a source told me that Akers would have a much bigger role Week 2 than he had Week 1. But even if the source was right, Henderson made everything work at just $5700 so I stuck with him. I wasn’t willing to compromise the Sun God to get off DHendo. Even at just 50% of the RB workload Henderson was a decent play in this spot. We projected 63%.

I considered Darius Slayton , Jerry Jeudy, Jahan Dotson , Kevin Austin, Darius Cooper, and Dante Pettis for two spots. It made it easy to punt these WR spots since I didn’t like much in the mid-range.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 16 (Dec 22, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-16-3_0d1b3f5b_2025.html: * I desperately needed to save money at WR. With Rashee Rice out, I thought there was a decent chance Xavier Worthy would fill those screens and drag routes that Rice eats on underneath. That’s what happened down the stretch last year, when Worthy became a very valuable fantasy player into the playoffs. Of course Gardner Minshew was a massive downgrade from Patrick Mahomes, but at just $4400 I was willing to risk it on Worthy. Especially against the pass-funneling Titans defense.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 14 (Dec 7, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-14-5_3ecf734d_2025.html: * I’ve played Michael Wilson in cash every time Marvin Harrison has been out. The matchup here against the Rams was certainly tough and Wilson was more expensive at $5600, but I also thought Jacoby Brissett would drop back another 40+ times. Wilson was our top salary-adjusted WR play on the slate.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 14 (Dec 7, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-14-5_3ecf734d_2025.html: * I didn’t consider Luther Burden a “must” in a vacuum. But in the context of the slate, I wanted to get the expensive RBs and didn’t love the expensive WRs. So to spend just $3800 on a talented player ( perhaps the best WR on the Bears ) with Rome Odunze out was a treat. Even if Burden didn’t project all that great.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 13 (Nov 30, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-13-4_36238941_2025.html: * The wide receiver position was brutally overpriced across the board. I liked both Puka Nacua and Jaxon Smith-Njigba , but they were fully priced. In the end, I decided that although JSN was all the way up at $9500, this slate called for a player who could break it. So I went with the “stars and scrubs” approach at WR in JSN and Jayden Higgins , who I considered the safest sub-$4K WR. I also looked at AD Mitchell and John Metchie for cheap.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 13 (Nov 30, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-13-4_36238941_2025.html: Week 13 Results I’m fine with the CJ Stroud play on DK. Yes he failed, but he dropped back nearly 40 times in a dome with all his weapons healthy… and simply ran bad on TDs. The play I’d like to have back is forcing in Jaxson Smith-Njigba on such a tightly-priced slate. Paying $9500 for a receiving in a home game against “Max Brosmer” was stretching it, and prevented me from upgrading at QB and WR. That said, there simply weren’t many mid-range WRs worth paying for – I liked Jaylen Waddle, Ladd McConkey, Chris Olave, but all were a bit overpriced. Khalil Shakir dropping a TD plus Gadsden getting stopped at the 1-yard line were tough beats, but I don’t think this DK team was one of my best. Luckily I ran into a big Alec Pierce and Brissett game on FanDuel, plus got the Kyle Pitts TE decision right.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 12 (Nov 24, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-12-4_243a596c_2025.html: * Jameson Williams is not the kind of WR I typically play in cash. We are typically looking for less volatile, more volume-driven players. But with Sam LaPorta out and Dan Campbell changing JaMo’s route tree, I felt really good about his volume here. Add in the dome setup against a Giants team ranked 28th in yards per play allowed, and I was fine with it. Note that JaMo’s ceiling projection was outsized compared to base, and I think that matters… even in cash.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 11 (Nov 17, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-11-4_f8a100f7_2025.html: But I thought this 3v3 was really close because I really liked the ceiling of Dowdle and Chase – whereas the ceiling on Jennings and Washington was tough to see. I also didn’t love passing on Wilson as the No. 1 WR for Brissett at just $3800. Additionally, we had the Rico side 1.7 points ahead in projection . And I didn’t want to have Washington on both DK and FD, with Jakobi Meyers’ role set to grow in Jacksonville. So I ended up going with the Dowdle/Chase/Wilson side at the last minute.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 10 (Nov 10, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-10-4_cba6f8ca_2025.html: This was a difficult slate (on both sites) because the best plays were also the most expensive plays. Even the salary-savers at WR were in the $4000 range, rather than the $3000 range. We also had guys like JSN, CMC, and Puka getting closer to “full price”. Note: Unless stated otherwise, the discussion below is about DraftKings.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 10 (Nov 10, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-10-4_cba6f8ca_2025.html: MY WANT PLAYS * On most slates, Christian McCaffrey and De’Von Achane would’ve been musts. But there were so many great expensive WR plays , and so few viable cheap plays, that I looked at other stuff.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 10 (Nov 10, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-10-4_cba6f8ca_2025.html: * One of the reasons I was OK fading the expensive WRs was because I really liked the $4K range. Parker Washington was outplaying Brian Thomas Jr. even when BTJ was healthy. Now Washington had his chance to operate as the true No. 1 with both BTJ and Travis Hunter out. Jauan Jennings finally looked healthy in Week 9, giving us the 49ers true No. 1 WR at just $4700. And Tez Johnson was ticketed for an every-down role with Chris Godwin plus Mike Evans out – and I expected Christian Gonzalez to spend most of his time on Emeka Egbuka.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 10 (Nov 10, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-10-4_cba6f8ca_2025.html: * I decided to go with that three $4K WR lineup about 15 minutes before lock. I had JJ McCarthy and the Jaguars D/ST in, leaving me with $0 of remaining salary. I realized that I could go Jacoby Brissett and Browns D/ST instead. I didn’t like the matchups for JJM or Brissett. I did think Browns D was slightly better than Jaguars D. So I decided to make the move, it projected roughly even.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 8 (Oct 27, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-8-3_7584ccf3_2025.html: * Ja’Marr Chase was close to a “must” at $8100 against the hapless Jets with no Sauce Gardner and gunslinging Joe Flacco at the controls. We reeled in Chase’s projected target share some because our models suggested a wild 34.5% baseline here. And he projected as our best WR salary-adjusted value . The only reason I did not consider Chase a must was because it was difficult to play two of the elite RBs with him. And I thought that JT + Bijan was a viable strategy.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 7 (Oct 19, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-7-4_01bceb8a_2025.html: * On a different kind of slate, I wouldn’t have considered CeeDee Lamb a “must.” He sustained a severe ankle sprain one month ago, introducing a bit more health risk. But given how optimistic the Cowboys sounded about Lamb’s health, and this truly outlier (relative to slate) projected game environment, I needed the alpha at $7500. Lamb and Rice were our two best WR salary-adjusted values in projections by a wide margin.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 7 (Oct 19, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-7-4_01bceb8a_2025.html: Olave was easily my favorite, as the Bears came into this game dead last in yards per play allowed and Olave’s underlying metrics remained extremely strong. As noted on Last-Minute Livestream , any weather concerns were already baked into projections – and Olave was our No. 3 WR in salary-adjusted value.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 6 (Oct 12, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-6-4_1a7f9202_2025.html: * Jaxon Smith-Njigba was easily our No. 2 WR in salary-adjusted value . He’s having one of the most insane starts to a season ever on a per-route basis, yet was still just $7600 on full-PPR DraftKings. JSN is Puka-lite, I’ve played him almost every cash slate this season.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 6 (Oct 12, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-6-4_1a7f9202_2025.html: MY WANT PLAYS * I only considered two QBs: Trevor Lawrence ($5100) and Drake Maye ($5900). I preferred Maye by a decent margin, but did not see viable ways to get to him without punting a WR spot – something I did not want to do. So I was fine to just punt QB at this borderline free price on Lawrence, who was facing the Seahawks without three of their top-four secondary pieces.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 5 (Oct 7, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-5-4_6bacf558_2025.html: MY MUST PLAYS * Jaxon Smith-Njigba came into Week 5 sporting an absurd 34% target share and 76% catch rate on a strong 12.8-yard aDOT. It’s an outrageous role and talent profile for someone priced at just $7100 in full-PPR. On top of that, he was facing a pass-funneling Bucs defense which was without top CB Jamel Dean. JSN was easily our best WR value on the slate.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 5 (Oct 7, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-5-4_6bacf558_2025.html: * As usual, it was a very weak WR slate. I only thought four were in play for cash: JSN (see above), Chris Olave , Jaylen Waddle, and Jakobi Meyers . With Brock Bowers out and a plus matchup against the Colts, Meyers became a priority. I would have played Waddle over Olave on DK (as I did on FD) with Tyreek Hill out, but it didn’t fit.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 2 (Sep 15, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-2-4_2ae947ca_2025.html: Getting Patrick Mahomes’ No. 1 WR at just $5200 was a fine cash play even against the Eagles, so Marquise Brown was an easy click. I looked at some teams that had Ricky Pearsall or Calvin Ridley, but in the end I had the money to get into the higher part of the mid-range. Jaxon Smith-Ngijba could lead the NFL in target share and was $6000 – an ideal kind of cash play. And Tee Higgins is someone I don’t typically love playing in cash because his range of outcomes is so wide. But at $6100 against the Jaguars, he was my favorite in that range.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 2 (Sep 15, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-2-4_2ae947ca_2025.html: Week 2 Results I was happy with most of my decisions this week. The highlight was thinking rationally about the Dolphins situation and not fear-mongering my way off De’Von Achane. I was also happy I identified JSN as the kind of mid-range WR I want to play in cash. As for FanDuel, I thought the big 3v3 was Derrick Henry, Tyler Warren, and Calvin Ridley vs. Tony Pollard, Trey McBride, and Tee Higgins. We talked about this one a ton on Sunday morning shows , I honestly thought it was a flip and we had it roughly even in projection. Was fortuante to come out ahead on that one, as I never would’ve thought Derrick Henry would fail in this spot as the Ravens won 41-17.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 18 (Jan 6, 2025 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-18-3_df597acd_2024.html: * The biggest decision points on DraftKings once again came at wide receiver. It’s been like that for seemingly the last 1-2 months. There were six WRs I considered for cash: Michael Pittman , Jakobi Meyers, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Drake London , Brian Thomas, and Mike Evans .
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 18 (Jan 6, 2025 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-18-3_df597acd_2024.html: I looked at teams that punted at wide receiver in order to get to Brian Thomas, but that went out the window once Darnell Mooney (hamstring) was scratched. At that point, Drake London’s projected target share at $6500 against a brutal Panthers defense was too strong to ignore. London was our third-best WR value in projection , behind only Evans and Thomas.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 17 (Dec 29, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-17-3_9959446c_2024.html: * I had six wide receivers on my list for cash: Justin Jefferson, Mike Evans, Brian Thomas, Josh Downs , Michael Pittman, and Dontayvion Wicks . I actually felt strongest about Downs, but didn’t think any of these WRs were musts. So I simply played the trio that fit. Wicks, with Christian Watson out, had a path to an every-down role in a strong game environment at just $3900. And Downs was priced as if inept thrower Anthony Richardson was starting, even though it would be chucker Joe Flacco. I felt fine with the ceiling combo at those price tags.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 17 (Dec 29, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-17-3_9959446c_2024.html: Week 17 Results Losing Tyjae Spears (concussion) early hurt some. But I ran hot to get 2-36-1 out of Payne Durham on just three targets. Of course, the big dagger was the WR situation. There were some teams I saw that didn’t have either of Saquon or Justin Jefferson, but got up to Brian Thomas and Mike Evans. Perhaps going that more balanced route to access more solid WR play was right.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 16 (Dec 23, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-16-2_28f00192_2024.html: * I considered combinations of literally seven different wide receivers for three spots: Keenan Allen, DK Metcalf , DJ Moore , Jakobi Meyers , Malik Nabers, Brian Thomas. I had a really, really hard time parsing between them.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 16 (Dec 23, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-16-2_28f00192_2024.html: * I thought both Bills D/ST and Falcons D/ST were extremely strong. But I preferred spending more on the WR spot than defense. So I settled for the sub-$3k defense that projected best for us: Raiders against Mac Jones. It made it easier to not get up at defense on DraftKings since I knew I was playing Falcons on FanDuel.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 14 (Dec 8, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-14-3_b95658ea_2024.html: * I would never call an expensive tight end a “must.” As I discussed on last week’s always free Solo Pod , tight end floor/ceiling combos are often not what they appear. But Brock Bowers is effectively an alpha wide receiver facing one of the best pass-game matchups (TB) at $6500. I didn’t love paying that much at the position, but we had so much room to spend on this slate I thought it was fine.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 14 (Dec 8, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-14-3_b95658ea_2024.html: * Jauan Jennings has easily emerged as the 49ers No. 1 wide receiver. Yet he was priced at $5200. Regardless of matchup or offensive line play, the alpha WR for a Kyle Shanahan offense at this price is going to be a play. The only reason Jennings wasn’t a “must” was because the mid-range was littered with strong options (see below).
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 14 (Dec 8, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-14-3_b95658ea_2024.html: * I was all set to play Jerry Jeudy and Jakobi Meyers at the other two wide receiver spots on my DK team. But then George Pickens (hamstring) was scratched late. My first thought when this happened was it could give me access to one of my favorite plays on the slate, Justin Jefferson.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 13 (Dec 2, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-13-3_a8bf73ad_2024.html: This was an uncomfortable slate on DraftkIngs due to the quality of mid-range tight end options and a lack of cheap WR options. Note: Unless stated otherwise, the discussion below is about DraftKings.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 13 (Dec 2, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-13-3_a8bf73ad_2024.html: * I certainly didn’t love David Moore . But we needed to save money somewhere on this slate, and I thought he was clearly the safest WR play under $4000. With Jalen Coker and Ja’Tavion Sanders out, we knew Moore would be in all 3-WR sets while competing for targets with Adam Thielen and Xavier Legette.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 13 (Dec 2, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-13-3_a8bf73ad_2024.html: * My last WR spot came down to Tee Higgins or Mike Evans. My gut preferred Evans as the clear WR1 against the Panthers. But Higgins’ underlying usage has actually been better than Ja’Marr Chase, and there was little reason to think that wouldn’t continue here.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 13 (Dec 2, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-13-3_a8bf73ad_2024.html: * Regular readers know I hate paying up at tight end in cash. But there were no TE options under $3000, and the mid-range options were actually quite strong when compared to WR counterparts in the $4000-$5000 range. Evan Engram ’s PPR floor with Trevor Lawrence back at just $4800 was high.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 12 (Nov 24, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-12-3_4cb7e148_2024.html: I really liked this slate on DraftKings. There were a few of different ways to go at WR, TE, and D/ST. Picking the right ones would be the key. Note: Unless stated otherwise, the discussion below is about DraftKings.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 12 (Nov 24, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-12-3_4cb7e148_2024.html: * Regular readers know I rarely, if ever, want to pay $5800 for tight end. Especially when it’s a 35-year-old one who likely wouldn’t be needed to beat Carolina. So I was happy to get down off Kelce in favor of getting more firepower at wide receiver. The choices were Nico Collins ($7600), Tyreek Hill ($7200), or CeeDee Lamb ($7300). We had them all projected very close, but Nico was the one I wanted. If he didn’t get that long touchdown called back in Week 11, people would’ve been more excited about him. He didn’t have the systemic risk of Lamb’s Cowboys, and didn’t have the health/decline concerns of Tyreek. With Stef Diggs out and another week removed from the hamstring pull, I considered Nico the best raw WR on the slate.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 11 (Nov 17, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-11-3_a86ffd69_2024.html: MY WANT PLAYS * Other than Jauan Jennings , I didn’t think there were any great plays at WR. We only had four WRs on the entire DK slate with a positive salary-adjusted value in our projections . So it was necessary to punt off a WR spot, and I was fine doing that. Given that Kayshon Boutte had run 100% of the routes the last two weeks, I liked the spot for Drake Maye, and he was just $3500… I thought Boutte was the best salary-saver at WR. That didn’t mean I was happy about playing him.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 10 (Nov 11, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-10-3_2310eb29_2024.html: * DeAndre Hopkins was at a pricepoint that made everything fit. I didn’t love him against Patrick Surtain, but we had a chance to get Patrick Mahomes’ clear No. 1 WR for $5300. If the pricing came out before Hopkins’ Week 9 MNF role, he would have been $6000 or more.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 9 (Nov 4, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-9-3_15a92484_2024.html: * Regular readers know my preference is to pay down at tight end. The floor/ceiling combo is rarely worth spending up. So I was thrilled to jam in Mike Gesicki once we learned Tee Higgins (quad) would miss again. As I noted in this data , Gesicki’s targets per route run and target share are very strong when Tee misses. That makes sense, has he lines up as a WR on an overwhelming majority of his snaps.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 9 (Nov 4, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-9-3_15a92484_2024.html: I think these situations need to be taken on a case-by-case basis. In this case, we’re talking about a very expensive QB/WR combo. We’re also talking about an offense which has frankly been inept for the last month. I thought both Dak and CeeDee were fine plays, but priced roughly right. I also liked the under in the game, as we talked about on Last Minute Livestream . And so I knew that if I played both Dak and CeeDee here, my whole week would come down to how the Cowboys fared. And given state of the team, that wasn’t something I was comfortable with. Meanwhile, with Ekeler as the feature back I expected a more pass-heavy approach from the Commanders – clearly good for Daniels. And from a salary-based value perspective, we only had London 0.4 behind Lamb. In fact, the Daniels side of this 3v3 was 0.9 ahead in our base projection and 1.6 ahead in ceiling projection . The fact that I could get to Titans D/ST here instead of Giants was the icing on the cake. We had Titans as the best D/ST play on the slate against the Patriots woeful offensive line.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 9 (Nov 4, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-9-3_15a92484_2024.html: * I certainly expected Jameis Winston to come back to earth against a good Chargers defense. However, our DvP data still had this as a neutral matchup for WRs. And at just $4300, there was plenty of room for error on Cedric Tillman . Especially considering they are scheming him first-team looks, and he won the game for them last week – I felt really good about the opportunity he’d have. Tillman was the only WR under $5300 I considered for cash.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 7 (Oct 20, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-7-3_f919d58d_2024.html: * Spending up at QB on DraftKings on this slate didn’t feel great. It was so tightly priced at WR, and I am usually confident I can find reasonable 15-20 points for cheap. Some of the 2v2s and 3v3s I looked at involved going down to one of Daniel Jones, Geno Smith, or Sam Darnold. And then up at wide receiver to Tee Higgins or Tank Dell. But I didn’t feel great about those upgrades, so in the end I stuck with Jayden Daniels . Given this matchup with the Panthers and the way he scores fantasy points, there was almost no way Daniels could fail.

Which I was fine with because, again, I didn’t love the mid-range for cash. My two favorites below $5000 were Jordan Whittington with Cooper Kupp (ankle) still out. And Juju Smith-Schuster playing some version of the Rashee Rice role.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 7 (Oct 20, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-7-3_f919d58d_2024.html: Week 7 Results This was one of the most tilting slates I can remember. I had Jayden Daniels in cash on both sites, Jordan Whittington on both sites, and Juju Smith-Schuster on DK. Obviously it’s very hard to win when the injury bug bites this hard. The Whittington and Juju plays are on me, but it’s a frustrating runout nonetheless. I do think that paying up for QB when we had such weak WR options at the low end was probably bad. That said, Jayden was likely going to have 25+ points if he stayed healthy – Marcus Mariota scored 19.6.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 6 (Oct 13, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-6-3_7120002a_2024.html: * A hard part of these kind of slates on DK is that we have to play a WR we don’t really love. That’s just what happens when a slate is priced tightly and there are no exciting spots at cheap WR. It’s very uncomfortable, there’s no doubt.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 5 (Oct 7, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-5-3_aea25aa9_2024.html: * I didn’t have a big pool of cash options at WR, but it was still a struggle to decide between them. I thought the five in play were: Deebo Samuel, Jayden Reed , Michael Pittman , Dontayvion Wicks, and Jordan Whittington .
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 5 (Oct 7, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-5-3_aea25aa9_2024.html: I did prefer Wicks to Whittington. But I didn’t want to come off Purdy to find the $400, as noted above. So given that I already had Wicks on FanDuel, and Whittington had the short-area role as arguably WR KingMaker Matthew Stafford’s No. 1 WR, I was OK with it.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 5 (Oct 7, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-5-3_aea25aa9_2024.html: Week 5 Results I was really happy with the way I handled Deebo Samuel and quarterback on DK. There’s just so much opportunity cost at wide receiver there, we need to be certain every spot is really strong – especially if we are paying up. So by middling it (play Brock Purdy, not Deebo), I think I gave myself more outs.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 4 (Sep 30, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-4-3_35bd5775_2024.html: * In Week 3, we saw Andy Dalton step in and immediately execute the Dave Canales passing offense at an extremely high level. In that game, Diontae Johnson saw 14 targets for a 38% share. I didn’t think Diontae would sniff 40% again, but his price was oddly just $5600. Even with Adam Thielen (hamstring) out and the Bengals defense springing tons of leaks. A classic cash-game must, especially when we consider the projection. We had docks on Diontae for his groin injury, and he still was our best salary-adjusted WR value on the slate.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 4 (Sep 30, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-4-3_35bd5775_2024.html: * I know Dallas Goedert (no AJ Brown or Devonta Smith) and Brock Bowers (no Davante Adams or Michael Mayer) were both strong. But on DraftKings, I rarely want to sacrifice WR firepower for the shaky floor/ceiling combos at tight end. So I had no problem punting it off with pass-catching option Elijah Higgins , who was filling in for Trey McBride (out, concussion). We couldn’t draw up a much better matchup or game environment for a punt TE.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 3 (Sep 23, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-3-3_bb4b1713_2024.html: * The third WR spot this week was really tough. I thought any of Jauan Jennings (no Deebo or Kittle), Rome Odunze (no Keenan Allen), Tank Dell (too cheap at $5200), Rashid Shaheed, Devonta Smith, and Nico Collins were all options. In the end, I wanted a floor. And in our projections , Jaxon Smith-Ngijba had the highest floor among the low-$5K options. I also thought JSN’s 16 targets from Week 2 were notable simply because deep-route running Dell and Shaheed could never sniff that.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 3 (Sep 23, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-3-3_bb4b1713_2024.html: But given the way the tight end slate was priced, I thought punting the position was right. I didn’t expect any real points, but when most of the position fails then spending the least possible works. More importantly, I want to prioritize WR spend when it’s close – that’s the position where we make our money. Anyway, the last 2v2 I looked at was Foster Moreau and Titans D/ST or Eric Saubert and Bucs D/ST. Moreau is a reasonable pass-catcher, while Saubert’s long history in the NFL is as a blocker. So with Malik Willis starting for the Packers, I went with the Moreau/TEN side.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 2 (Sep 16, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-2-3_fab8f145_2024.html: MY MUST PLAYS * I would’ve considered playing Cooper Kupp at $7600 against the Cardinals even if Puka Nacua was healthy. But with Nacua (knee) out, Kupp was a stone-cold lock. Anything less than 30% of the targets for Kupp from the WR kingmaker Matthew Stafford would’ve been a surprise. And the matchup/game environment in Arizona was elite as well.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 2 (Sep 16, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-2-3_fab8f145_2024.html: * Given all the “musts” above, I knew I’d have to punt at one WR spot. The options to me were clear: Allen Lazard , Andrei Iosivas, or Tyler Johnson. I didn’t want four Rams, so Johnson was out. I preferred Iosivas to Lazard as the player in the better game environment with the better quarterback. Iosivas also projected to play 100% of the snaps again with Tee Higgins (hamstring) out. But in the end, I didn’t think it was worth the $500 I would’ve needed to get to Yoshi.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 1 (Sep 9, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-1-2_2a733f11_2024.html: Meanwhile Tyreek Hill was the NFL’s MVP last season and the Dolphins were extremely thin at pass-catcher behind him/Waddle. The Dolphins were at home in the slate’s highest total. I would’ve paid at least $9400 for Tyreek in this spot, but he was just $8700. He was a lock once we knew his “detainment” before the game wasn’t an issue. Tyreek was 3.7 points clear of any other WR on the slate in our Week 1 Main Slate projections .
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 1 (Sep 9, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-1-2_2a733f11_2024.html: MY WANT PLAYS * I only considered four RBs for cash: Rachaad White , Alvin Kamara, De’Von Achane , Bijan Robinson. Given the context of the slate, I knew I’d be playing four WRs. The values at WR were simply better. The big decision was Alvin Kamara ($6700) vs. De’Von Achane ($6800). I preferred Achane as the player on the rise with the NFL’s best schemer in the slate’s highest game total. I also thought there was a lot of room for Achane to be used as a pass-catcher given the Dolphins’ lack of depth there.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 1 (Sep 9, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-1-2_2a733f11_2024.html: * The last two WR spots came down to two 1v1s at roughly the same prices: Christian Kirk vs. Tank Dell , and Malik Nabers vs. Drake London.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 1 (Sep 9, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-1-2_2a733f11_2024.html: I had some light concerns Kirk wouldn’t be on in 2-WR sets, and also questioned his ceiling relative to Dell. Yes Dell also didn’t project to play in 2-WR sets, but he + Stroud can break the slate on relatively little volume. I want to be leaning into ceiling more, especially when I’m playing a lot of head-to-heads. Unlike double ups, it’s far better to have a 90th percentile lineup than a 55th.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 18 (Jan 7, 2024 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-18-2_131274d6_2023.html: This was a typical Week 18 slate. We had cheap RBs thrust into volume for non-motivated teams. And we had elite WR options in clean spots.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 18 (Jan 7, 2024 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-18-2_131274d6_2023.html: But once Kirk was deemed inactive, I decided to take the Mundt savings and use that money to upgrade at wide receiver. Mundt is playing a version of the TJ Hockenson role and had the elite matchup against the Lions pass defense I described above.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 18 (Jan 7, 2024 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-18-2_131274d6_2023.html: When min-priced Christian Kirk was scratched, I was struggling at the third WR spot. Olave was the one who fit and still gave me the construction I wanted to play. So it was a “last guy in and he has a ceiling, how bad can it be” kind of play.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 17 (Jan 1, 2024 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-17-2_f86855e6_2023.html: Also, not playing Jalen Hurts or Lamar Jackson on Fanduel was suicidal. But on DraftKings, punting quarterback was firmly in play because there was simply nowhere to save – roughly every WR was overpriced. On FanDuel, Zay Flowers was a cheap lock. There were no cheap locks on DraftKings.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 16 (Dec 25, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-16_7712239d_2023.html: * I only considered two tight ends: Evan Engram ($6300) or Trey McBride ($7000). Engram had the same setup as I described above regarding Calvin Ridley. McBride had a much tougher matchup, but has elite usage (even if he was a WR). I decided to let the rest of my lineup dictate which of these two tight ends I would play.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 16 (Dec 25, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-16_7712239d_2023.html: Most of all though, I was happy I didn’t jam in the RBs I liked best as it would’ve forced me off of CeeDee Lamb and onto a weak WR like Garrett Wilson or DeAndre Hopkins. And I identified that it was fine to play both Evan Engram and Calvin Ridley in this spot. Good to get another strong week in the books after a frustrating start to the season.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 15 (Dec 17, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-15-2_65fa60fe_2023.html: * Given how expensive CMC was, I knew I’d have to find some value at wide receiver. The good news is that on FanDuel there were two very strong WR plays in the $6K range.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 15 (Dec 17, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-15-2_65fa60fe_2023.html: * The Chiefs’ undisputed No. 1 WR at just $6500? Yes please. As noted here, Rashee Rice finally got himself into a full-time role last week. The Chiefs’ target tree is very flat and not sticky week-to-week, so I didn’t think Rice was a lock up at $6100 on DraftKings. But given the setup on FanDuel, it was impossible to fade him.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 14 (Dec 10, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-14-2_bd55895c_2023.html: In other words, I thought CEH at $4200 with a 10-14 touch projections playing with Patrick Mahomes was better than London or Jaxon Smith-Ngiba or Jonathan Mingo or any other cheap WR play. I also felt really good about Keenan Allen’s volume with Josh Palmer still on the sideline, Mike Williams of course out for year, Quentin Johnston being incapable, and the defense struggling so badly.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 13 (Dec 3, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-13-2_c9cb0c42_2023.html: MY MUST PLAYS * The Commanders are one of the best possible matchups for opposing pass games, as we’ve been discussing all season. They have no pass rush (especially after trading Chase Young + Montez Sweat) and an inept secondary – aka no prayer of slowing down Tyreek Hill . Even at $9600 on DraftKings, we had Tyreek projected as the best salary-adjusted WR on DraftKings by a wide margin. And atop Top Plays . You couldn’t draw up a better spot for the unstoppable Hill.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 13 (Dec 3, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-13-2_c9cb0c42_2023.html: * I knew I’d have to punt one WR position in order to fit CMC and Tyreek. That was fine since I didn’t really like any mid-range WRs other than Chris Olave ($6900). The punt that easily made the most sense was Elijah Moore ($3500), who already had good chemistry with Joe Flacco from their time together in New York. Moore was also playing in a dome and even at age 38, Flacco looked like a stabilizing presence for the Browns pass game.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 12 (Nov 26, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-12-2_727f489a_2023.html: * I really struggled with the WR spots on FanDuel this week. I thought AJ Brown was an awesome play, but I got off him for a few reasons: The rain forecast in Philly kept getting worse, I didn’t want to punt a WR spot with a Justin Watson or Robert Woods type, and I already had Brown covered with Jalen Hurts.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 10 (Nov 12, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-10_446ac3b4_2023.html: * I thought the $6000 range at WR was fairly strong. I already mentioned Tank Dell ($6400) as a must. We also had Tyler Boyd ($6200), Marquise Brown ($6600), Christian Kirk ($6700), and Tyler Lockett ($6800).
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 9 (Nov 5, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-9-2_9643345e_2023.html: * We can be looser with our wide receiver spots on FanDuel because there are no 100-yard bonuses and it’s half-PPR. Given that, I thought just grabbing reasonable floor at a bargain-basement $5400 for Demario Douglas was a must. With Kendrick Bourne (ACL) out, I fully expected “Pop” to lead the Patriots in targets. In one of the best possible matchups for an offense.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 9 (Nov 5, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-9-2_9643345e_2023.html: * AJ Brown could’ve been considered a must. Given the context of the slate, he was very easy to get to and was 1.7 points clear of all other WRs in our projections. But $9000 for a wide receiver on FanDuel is tough to consider a must. Still, on a slate with so few options to feel strong about, I wanted the alpha status of AJB.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 8 (Oct 29, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-8-2_36af805e_2023.html: * I knew I wanted three $7K+ RBs and an expensive quarterback. I think emphasizing those positions is the optimal way to play cash on FanDuel. Of course, that means spending down a bit at WR – which I’m fine with in half-PPR and no bonuses. So it’s not that I loved Zay Flowers and thought he was a “must” in a vacuum. But in the context of this slate and the format, Flowers at just $6500 was a lock for me.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 6 (Oct 15, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-6-2_12c0d3b1_2023.html: * On most slates, Christian Kirk would’ve been more of a “want” than a “must”. But on this slate, the wide receiver pool was quite thin in the low- and mid-range. With Zay Jones (knee) out and an ideal pace/matchup against the Colts, Kirk was the key to the kind of build I wanted to play. We actually had Kirk projected for the exact same amount of points as Calvin Ridley… but Kirk was $1300 cheaper.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 6 (Oct 15, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-6-2_12c0d3b1_2023.html: I also wish I had leaned into Kyle Pitts over Logan Thomas – obviously Pitts’ floor is roughly zero, but he’s getting true WR-style usage at just $3500 and had a very good matchup. All in all, I am fine with the team. Considering the Foreman mistake and the Fields injury, I’m happy to escape relatively unscathed.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 5 (Oct 8, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-5-2_1447fa3c_2023.html: As for Chase, I’m sure a ton of people considered him a “must” today given that Tee Higgins was out and the matchup against Arizona. He was our best WR value in projections by a decent margin. These are not spots I typically fade. I did think Joe Burrow’s calf issues would force him into a ton more short throws, and Boyd’s targets per route run this year have been solid even with Tee Higgins in the lineup. And if I’m being honest, playing Chase in Weeks 1 and 3 when he failed weighed on me.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 5 (Oct 8, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-5-2_1447fa3c_2023.html: * We had four solid WR “punt” options in Wan’Dale Robinson , Kalif Raymond , Josh Reynolds, and Tyler Boyd (see above). I knew I’d have to play at least one of them, if not two or three. I thought Boyd was the strongest of the group, followed by Reynolds. Even at $900 more, I did think Reynolds was stronger than Raymond – Reynolds has the long-standing chemistry with Jared Goff and already had a solid role even when Amon-Ra St. Brown (out, abdomen) is in. But I wasn’t going to force in Reynolds, as Raymond was already mixing in ahead of Marvin Jones Jr. and also was capable of playing the slot.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 5 (Oct 8, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-5-2_1447fa3c_2023.html: But that said, all I needed to do was play Ja’Marr Chase and nothing else would’ve mattered. So consciously not prioritizing the WR we had atop Top Plays and as our best projected WR stings. Even though I thought the calf stuff was overblown, I clearly let Chase and Joe Burrow’s early-season struggles bias me too much. So no excuses, I deserve the pain.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 4 (Oct 1, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-4-2_fc4b8140_2023.html: * A case could’ve been made for both CMC (see above) and Puka Nacua as “musts.” I thought they were close to that. But there were so many other expensive plays I liked around them: Ja’Marr Chase, Tony Pollard, Stef Diggs, Tyreek Hill. That said, Puka with a healthy Matthew Stafford in some version of the Cooper Kupp role against a Colts secondary devoid of talent in a dome at $6700 was incredibly strong. He was our No. 2 WR in Top Plays and our third-best salary-adjusted value on the entire slate.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 4 (Oct 1, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-4-2_fc4b8140_2023.html: * I thought there were zero strong WR options in the $3K range. But there were three very strong WR options in the $4K range: Josh Palmer , Adam Thielen, Tank Dell. I did play with lineups that rostered two of these guys (see below).
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 3 (Sep 24, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-3-2_166efcd0_2023.html: MY MUST PLAYS * I had a very small WR pool for cash this week as the pricing was tight. Only really considered Tank Dell, Adam Thielen, Christian Kirk, Mike Williams , Keenan Allen, Tyreek Hill, and Justin Jefferson.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 3 (Sep 24, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-3-2_166efcd0_2023.html: I thought the most mis-priced of those options was Williams, and our projections agreed as we had him as the best salary-adjusted WR value on the slate. Although BMW is not the archtype of player I typically like to play in cash (Keenan Allen is), getting a strong piece of the LAC-MIN game environment for just $6000 was a must.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 3 (Sep 24, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-3-2_166efcd0_2023.html: * I actually preferred the safety of Adam Thielen ($3900) in cash to Tank Dell ($3600) at punt wide receiver. I didn’t consider any other sub-$4k WRs seriously. Thielen got a QB upgrade in Andy Dalton and also is the kind of cash WR I can play for floor.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 2 (Sep 19, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-2-2_f6692ae4_2023.html: * I know I was on an island with this take, but I personally considered Puka Nacua a must at $4900 – even though the math didn’t back it up. He was quietly a good prospect coming out, had league-best underlying usage in Week 1, and most importantly is playing with the WR kingmaker. Matthew Stafford has turned wideouts like Kenny Golladay and Marvin Jones into stars. He’s led record-setting seasons from Calvin Johnson and Cooper Kupp. We had Puka projected for a mean of 7.7 targets, a massive number for someone at this price. Even in a difficult matchup, I wasn’t passing on his role at sub-$5k.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 2 (Sep 19, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-2-2_f6692ae4_2023.html: MY WANT PLAYS * As usual, I was looking to pay down at tight end. Especially with Travis Kelce and Mark Andrews both coming off injuries. I would have been fine with any of Luke Musgrave , Chig Okonkwo, or Dalton Kincaid. They were all $3300 or less, allowing me to spend up at WR. I ended up going with nearly every-down Musgrave to get some access to a Packers offense playing without both Christian Watson (hamstring) and Aaron Jones (hamstring). This team did not have $100 left over, otherwise I may have gone Kincaid to block some Josh Allen points. I knew Allen was going to be very popular in cash.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 2 (Sep 19, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-2-2_f6692ae4_2023.html: As for my other alpha WR, I would have preferred Diggs to mitigate the Josh Allen chalk. But I didn’t think it was worth coming off of Chase, who I expected to have a massive bounce-back game in a clean setup against the Ravens. In hindsight, Keenan against the pass-funneling Titans with Austin Ekeler’s targets removed may have been better. * The last 2v2 I looked at was Anthony Richardson and Rachaad White vs. Daniel Jones and David Montgomery . I went back and forth about three times in last 10 minutes before lock. In the end, I thought A-Rich and Dimes were pretty close – but I wanted Montgomery as part of that SEA-DET game environment. I wasn’t really buying the rhetoric out of Detroit that Jahmyr Gibb’s role would expand – they won in Kansas City with DMont as the feature back. And his pass-game role was better than it seemed in that game, despite zero catches.

Daniel Jones was just 2.8% owned in the big $25 double up (despite being tied with Josh Allen as our best salary-adjusted QB play of the week ). Puka Nacua was only 20.6% (despite being our fourth-best salary-adjusted WR play of the week ). Montgomery was 17%. I was also very fortunate that both Nacua and Dimes hit in a big way. So I’ll take the win quietly and move on.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 1 (Sep 10, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-1_a52e1275_2023.html: * I wanted to play Tyler Higbee at tight end, but at $4,800, DraftKings somehow priced him higher than David Njoku, Pat Freiermuth, Evan Engram, and other solid tight ends. That was simply too steep. So the options were Luke Musgrave, a lock for an every-down role plus Christian Watson (hamstring) was out. Or Isaiah Likely , subbing for Mark Andrews (quad). I actually thought this one was closer than other people did, even though I do think Likely is an awesome talent. That’s because we had a new system, a new OC, and a ton of new talent at WR. Meanwhile, Musgrave’s role and target competition combo were strong.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 1 (Sep 10, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-1_a52e1275_2023.html: So I did look at some teams that saved the $500 by going down to the Raiders. But I could not get the upgrade at QB (off Anthony Richardson) or the upgrade at WR (off Ja’Marr Chase) that I wanted with that money. And quite frankly, Commanders D/ST was a very scary fade in this spot. Not only did Josh Dobbs barely get any practice time with his new team, but the Commanders’ DL over the Cardinals’ OL was Brandon Thorn’s No. 1 trench mismatch of the week.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 1 (Sep 10, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-1_a52e1275_2023.html: * The mid-range of WR was pretty weak. That made it a no-brainer to punt one spot with a min-priced guy. There were a ton of options: Marvin Mims , Jayden Reed, and Tutu Atwell were all in my cash pool. If someone played Kendrick Bourne or Puka Nacua, I think that would have been fine as well. I decided to go with Mims, as I thought he was the best talent in the group and I thought he had the best matchup.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 18 (Jan 8, 2023 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-18_48f2831b_2022.html: * Wide receiver was really tough this week. Despite the receiving yardage record talk, I didn’t think Justin Jefferson was in play with the weakly motivated Vikings talking about resting starters. I did have Ja’Marr Chase in for most of Sunday morning, but thought Stef Diggs was a bit better once we found out the Ravens were laying down. The Patriots, of course, had 10/10 motivation to stay fighting against the Bills.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 18 (Jan 8, 2023 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-18_48f2831b_2022.html: * My last decision was a simple 1v1, Garrett Wilson or Amari Cooper. I had the money for either. There’s no doubt that Wilson was a better play by almost any way you look at it rationally. Target share, matchup, youth, even game environment potentially. But I thought the Amari Cooper going for career-highs stuff actually mattered here, and he could/would see a higher target share than we could realistically project. So I went with Cooper, undeniably a very talented wide receiver with what I thought was a far better quarterback.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 17 (Jan 1, 2023 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-17_6932d3d0_2022.html: * Mike White (ribs) was mercifully cleared to start for the Jets, sending Zach Wilson back to the bench. That raised the team pass volume projection a bit and the pass efficiency projection significantly. It also meant that alpha rookie Garrett Wilson was far too cheap at just $5500 on a relatively weak WR slate.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 17 (Jan 1, 2023 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-17_6932d3d0_2022.html: * Given how weak the WR slate was for cash, I was looking for a viable punt. That came into play when DeAndre Hopkins was ruled out on Saturday. Greg Dortch already had a the slot role mostly to himself, but Nuk’s absence opened up a bunch more targets. Obviously I didn’t love playing Dortch with David Blough, but at $3000 on a slate I didn’t have very many WRs in my cash pool I thought it was correct.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 15 (Dec 18, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-15_9a34f1b6_2022.html: * Chris Moore wasn’t a “must” in a vacuum. But given the slate, he was the clear-cut puntish WR on a slate we needed to save at the position. Given Brandin Cooks and Nico Collins were out again, we had Moore for 7.4 targets against a beatable Chiefs secondary. That’s more than enough at $4200.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 15 (Dec 18, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-15_9a34f1b6_2022.html: * I thought the best teams punted one WR spot. However, once Jakobi Meyers was ruled in it was tough to figure out which one. I considered Nelson Agholor, Rasheed Shaheed, Marquez Valdes-Scantling, and Elijah Moore. Given how balky Rhamondre Stevenson (ankle) appeared to be, how little Jakobi (concussion) practiced, and the Raiders pass defense, I expected a pass-centric gameplan from the Patriots. I also didn’t think Meyers presence affected Agholor too much, as he doesn’t play a ton in the slot.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 14 (Dec 11, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-14_7847c1d8_2022.html: This was only a 10-game slate, and there weren’t many injury-induced values. It led to a situation where we had to pay down at QB, TE, D. And even then we had to decide between a stone punt at WR or a more balanced build.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 14 (Dec 11, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-14_7847c1d8_2022.html: * I didn’t love the mid-range options at WR. DJ Moore, Jerry Jeudy, Adam Thielen were fine but playing one of them left me with an awkward construction. So I thought it was fine to accept a 0-floor at one of the wideout spots, where we had some viable options. Brandin Cooks and Nico Collins were out, making Phillip Dorsett and Chris Moore starting WRs. Elijah Moore’s role was rising. Kendall Hinton was starting in place of Courtland Sutton. In this build, I only had exactly $3000 to spend. So there was no decision, I had to take a shot on the former first-round pick Philip Dorsett.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 14 (Dec 11, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-14_7847c1d8_2022.html: As for the first one above, I was a little worried the Chig Okonkwo role from Week 13 wouldn’t be sticky. For the same reason I wasn’t on D’Andre Swift in cash, Okonkwo role scared me. So with Courtland Sutton out and Greg Dulcich playing a WR-esque role in a spot the Broncos would have to throw a ton, I preferred him more than getting to Dalvin over Pollard.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 12 (Nov 27, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-12_5be72500_2022.html: MY WANT PLAYS * DeAndre Hopkins wasn’t a must because there were a ton of excellent WR plays. But with both of Arizona’s slot receivers (Rondale Moore, Greg Dortch) out, I expected Hopkins to get a ton of slot snaps. And that’s been an incredibly productive role in this offense all year. So even with Marquise Brown back for reportedly limited snaps, I wanted Hopkins as the slot man in this game environment. I preferred him to Tee Higgins, even at $800 more.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 11 (Nov 20, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-11_3cbe3f5b_2022.html: * I thought Stef Diggs was the best WR play on the slate, regardless of price. There was no way I was going to play CeeDee Lamb over Diggs for just $800 more. That said, I didn’t feel the need to stack Allen/Diggs – but I was definitely going to have at least one of them. Diggs entered Week 11 averaging 11 targets per game at an 11.5-yard aDOT. Just an absolutely insane role for someone at $8300 in a plus matchup in a dome.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 10 (Nov 14, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-10-2_41fd70d9_2022.html: Now, was Barkley worth coming off Amon-Ra and downgrading at defense? It was close, but I thought it was indeed worth it. Juju has cleanly emerged as Patrick Mahomes’ favorite WR in the NFL’s most pass-happy scheme. And I’m never going to let D/ST make a big decision for me. In other words, Cardinals D/ST at $2700 facing the Stafford-less Rams was a super strong play but D/ST is too unpredictable to be a “must” here.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 9 (Nov 6, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-9_beb78f9f_2022.html: MY WANT PLAYS * I looked at lineups that included both Josh Allen and Austin Ekeler. They would have had to punt a WR spot and play Brock Wright, or play two really thin WRs – something like Kalif Raymond, Terrace Marshall, or Zay Jones. On a full-PPR site with 100-yard bonuses, I wasn’t comfortable double punting with no floor or ceiling. So given that I considered Ekeler a must, I had to come off Allen.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 6 (Oct 18, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-6_d0a178f1_2022.html: MY WANT PLAYS * I looked at lineups that led with Ja’Marr Chase. It was certainly a great spot for him – the Saints have an elite rush defense, and Marshon Lattimore was out. But once Tee Higgins (ankle) was ruled in, I decided I preferred Stef Diggs . A lot of times in cash, I’ll take my expensive pass game exposure through the QB and be done with it. After all, tying up $16,600 in a QB-WR duo has some obvious concerns. But given the spot and game environment for Allen-Diggs here, I felt really good about it. We had Diggs for 10.8 targets, 1.1 more than Chase and in a better projected game environment.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 6 (Oct 18, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-6_d0a178f1_2022.html: Week 6 Results Obviously I’m not thrilled about coming out a small loser this week. But I’m mostly happy with my decisions. For just $1300 more on a loose slate, I think Alvin Kamara was significantly better than Kenneth Walker. I think avoiding Darrell Henderson as part of a 3-man backfield was right. I think skipping over that Christian Kirk/Chris Godwin tier at WR was right as well. I think avoiding two Seahawks receivers (DK Metcalf and Lockett) together was correct.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 5 (Oct 9, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-5_c6ef5a4e_2022.html: MY MUST PLAYS * Chris Godwin had a full-time role in Week 4, showing no ill-effects on his knee or hamstring issues. The Bucs also predictably reverted back to their extreme pass-happy style with all their wideouts healthy. Godwin’s role (opposite Mike Evans in 2-WR sets, slot in 3-WR sets) is incredibly valuable. In a very good matchup against the Falcons, I thought Godwin ($5900) was $500-$700 too cheap.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 5 (Oct 9, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-5_c6ef5a4e_2022.html: MY WANT PLAYS * I only considered two quarterbacks this week: Josh Allen ($8200) and Tom Brady ($6000). And it basically came down to a 2v2 – Allen/punt WR or Brady/Jeff Wilson. It was a complicated decision that I took right up to the last second. In the end, I liked but didn’t love the spot for Jeff Wilson. On the road with an injury-riddled offensive line and a meh pass-game role against a desperate Panthers team with some talented defenders. And Josh Allen was a virtual lock for 20 points, along with a bunch of 35+ games well within his range. As good as Tom Brady is, the floor/ceiling combo just isn’t comparable because he doesn’t run. Note this is a big change from previous years in cash, where I rarely spent up at QB. As we’ve discussed at length Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson, and Jalen Hurts have broken the position.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 5 (Oct 9, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-5_c6ef5a4e_2022.html: * Once I decided to go with Josh Allen plus punt WR, there were two options. I actually had Khalil Shakir in most of morning. But when Jarvis Landry (ankle) was scratched, Marquez Callaway entered the mix. The truth is that I didn’t think through this decision enough. It was close to lock, I was scrambling, and I just blew it. Easily the biggest mistake I’ve made this season. 1. Shakir is an unknown – we have no idea, he could be really good. We know Callaway isn’t very good, we have a large sample. 2. The Bills were desperate for secondary pass-catchers. Jamison Crowder, Isaiah McKenzie, and Dawson Knox were all out. Shakir projected for the slot role, a valuable role in this offense as Cole Beasley and McKenzie have shown. 3. Shakir’s QB was Josh Allen. Callaway’s QB was Andy Dalton.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 4 (Oct 3, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-4_f67c2e2c_2022.html: * As always, I let the rest of my roster dictate my D/ST. Of course I thought the Steelers, Giants, Eagles, Packers etc. were strong – but they were also far more than I like to pay for a D/ST in cash. There is very little predictability in defensive scoring, so we want to go cheap. I was certainly fine with the Bears D/ST at $2700 against mistake-prone Daniel Jones and his decimated WR corps.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 2 (Sep 19, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-2_489bfeb9_2022.html: * The Cardinals have one of the worst secondaries in the league. Davante Adams is capable of a 45% target share as we saw in Week 1. The Raiders also flashed some of the goal-line pass plays that made Adams such a unique fantasy WR in Green Bay. I wasn’t fading Adams at $8600 in this spot.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 2 (Sep 19, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-2_489bfeb9_2022.html: * I only really considered two quarterbacks: Trey Lance and Derek Carr . I thought briefly about Lamar Jackson, but playing him meant I would have had to sacrifice at wideout. And anytime it’s even close, I prefer to pay down at QB instead of WR. So I simply let the rest of my team and my 1pm ET start dictate who I played between Lance and Carr. In this build, I had the money for Carr (he was $500 more). And since I got off to a good start with Amon-Ra St. Brown, I thought the floor of Carr was better. If I had failed during the 1pm ET games, I may have swapped onto Lance for the ceiling.

On top of that, target hogs Jaylen Waddle and De’Von Achane were also scratched. Dulcich is a pure pass-catcher, that’s why he’s on the field. Passing on this at $2600 in cash was not a realistic option.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 16 (Dec 22, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-16-3_0d1b3f5b_2025.html: * Yes, the Bills have the best tight end defense in the league. But I’m always going to massively overweight raw volume vs. matchup, and Harold Fannin is a perfect example. With David Njoku out and Shadeur Sanders at QB, a 30%+ target share for Fannin as a 10.5-point dog was very much in play. At $4500, that’s a must.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 14 (Dec 7, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-14-5_3ecf734d_2025.html: MY WANT PLAYS * Based on projections , Kyle Pitts was a “must” here. We had him for 13.1 points at just $4200. Drake London was out, Kirk Cousins has clearly landed on Pitts as his favorite target, and the best way to beat Seattle’s defense is with tight end. However, I would’ve been willing to come off Pitts and punt with a Colston Loveland or Harold Fannin if it cleanly got me up to Josh Allen. Alas, it did not.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 13 (Nov 30, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-13-4_36238941_2025.html: * I struggled mightily with the tight end position this week. On really tightly priced slates, I think it is typically “right” to punt at both QB and TE. And I was all set to punt with one of Taysom Hill, Colby Parkinson, or AJ Barner. But at the last minute I decided to come off of Parkinson and Jaylen Waddle for Orande Gadsden and Khalil Shakir . On what I expected to be a very low-scoring slate, I wanted to find two upside spots here instead of just one.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 12 (Nov 24, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-12-4_243a596c_2025.html: * Trey McBride was the same story as last week. There were no viable punts at TE on DraftKings, and McBride is operating as the No. 1 for an extremely pass-centric and PPR-friendly offense. The advantage McBride provides over all other tight ends is impossible to ignore. So even though McBride was $800 more than last week, he was still a must on DK. Note that on FD, the $8500 tag was extremely difficult to fit… even though I wanted to.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 11 (Nov 17, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-11-4_f8a100f7_2025.html: This slate featured no viable punts at tight end and an excellent expensive play in Trey McBride. That tightened the slate to the point where we had to make some tough decisions – including evaluating whether we had to choose between Christian McCaffrey and Ja’Marr Chase. Note: Unless stated otherwise, the discussion below is about DraftKings.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 11 (Nov 17, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-11-4_f8a100f7_2025.html: MY MUST PLAYS * Regular readers know I am typically trying to spend as little as reasonable at tight end in DraftKings cash. But this week ( and last ) was an exception due to this elite Trey McBride role. The usage projected to get even better this week with Marvin Harrison out, plus a very good matchup against an injury-ravaged 49ers defense. I perhaps would have looked at a McBride fade if there was anything viable in the cheap range, but there simply wasn’t.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 10 (Nov 10, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-10-4_cba6f8ca_2025.html: I looked at a 2-TE team that faded CMC in an effort to play JSN or Puka Nacua. I looked at a team that faded Achane in favor of Treveyon Henderson, again in an effort to play one of the expensive WRs. But in the end, I thought Achane’s unique pass-catching plus explosive run ability was too much to ignore on full-PPR DraftKings. And as noted last week , McCaffrey’s current role is what cash-game dreams are made of. So I decided to fade the expensive WRs instead.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 10 (Nov 10, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-10-4_cba6f8ca_2025.html: * I knew Hunter Henry would be very popular in DK cash, but I considered him yet another “score a TD or bust” play. So I looked at all kinds of different TEs including Greg Dulcich ($2600), David Njoku ($3200), and George Kittle ($4500). I was fine playing whatever fit. But given I knew so many people were playing the low floor/ceiling Henry, I thought it was an interesting strategical play to try to blow them out of the water at TE with Trey McBride . Even at $6000, McBride was easily our best salary-adjusted play at the position.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 9 (Nov 2, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-9-4_dccd2f62_2025.html: * I would have been fine with a ton of tight ends this week. I thought Juwan Johnson , Theo Johnson (no Dan Bellinger), George Kittle, and Brock Bowers were all fine options. Regular readers know when it’s close, I’m almost always going to spend as little as possible at the tight end spot. So I was fine going to Johnson, whose role has remained very strong despite the return of Taysom Hill/Foster Moreau. If the Rams did blow out the Saints, Tyler Shough projected to get a ton of dropbacks.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 8 (Oct 27, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-8-3_7584ccf3_2025.html: * There were a ton of viable tight end plays. Dalton Schultz projected for a ton of targets relative to his price with both Nico Collins and Christian Kirk out. Dallas Goedert was already a decent play at $4200 with his red-zone role against the Giants, and became a very strong one once AJ Brown was ruled out. The best way to fit in 2+ stars on this slate was to go double tight end.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 7 (Oct 19, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-7-4_01bceb8a_2025.html: * Both Brock Bowers (knee) and Jakobi Meyers (knee/toe) were out. So even though it was a horrific spot for the Raiders at Arrowhead, there were a lot of outcomes where Michael Mayer led the team in targets at just $3500. I preferred Mayer to other TE punts such as Mason Taylor and Harold Fannin.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 7 (Oct 19, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-7-4_01bceb8a_2025.html: * The last 2v2 I looked at was Breece Hall and Jacory Croskey-Merritt vs. Jonathan Taylor and Zach Ertz . I thought it was very close, we had it almost even in projection. I talked to Silva about it during Last-Minute Livestream , and he felt strongly about the floor for Zach Ertz given the Commanders pass-catching situation. I never like playing TE in flex, but the appeal of getting to the skill player with our biggest base, floor, and ceiling projection (Jonathan Taylor) gave me a push over the edge. In hindsight, both Breece (systemic Jets failure) and JCM (lack of pass-game role) had shaky floors.

That said, I was proud of myself for not being stubborn and x-ing out all the 2-TE lineups. Every slate is unique, and we have to be willing to take what it gives us. The only regret I have is not putting this team in tournaments, as #TeamPlayTheBestPlays continues to smash.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 6 (Oct 12, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-6-4_1a7f9202_2025.html: Week 6 Results Certainly got unlucky that Puka Nacua (ankle) went down, that’s a huge salary to eat an injury at. So I was thrilled to escape with another solidly winning week. Really happy with the way I handled tight end. And given the way the usage went, think some version of the DK team I played was right. Note that this team was our optimal (based on our projections pre-lock). You can always find our optimals if you have an ETR In-Season Product subscription and The Solver add-on .

But I didn’t think it was worth punting TE or WR3 to get Breece in, and I was fine with Rico Dowdle. The Dolphins are one of the worst defenses in the NFL, and we didn’t expect the Panthers to trust Trevor Etienne.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 3 (Sep 21, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-3-4_842647f2_2025.html: * The only TEs I looked at for cash were Tyler Warren, Trey McBride , and Brock Bowers. And the only reason I was looking at expensive tight end was because of slate dynamics – I had to spend money somewhere. Given Warren’s toe issue, I preferred McBride. And we had McBride ahead of Bowers in projection despite Bowers costing more.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 2 (Sep 15, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-2-4_2ae947ca_2025.html: * We could certainly poke some holes in Harold Fannin . He’s not an every down player and had a more difficult matchup against the Ravens. But in cash, getting to spend just $3100 at tight end opens up the entire slate. I wasn’t going to think twice on Fannin after he was a featured part of the gameplan right out of the gate in Week 1, and was such an insanely productive college player.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 1 (Sep 8, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-1-3_2facc129_2025.html: Week 1 Results I got too locked onto an expensive D/ST on DraftKings, something I almost never do in DK cash. I also played a mid-range tight end with a questionable range of outcomes, also something I almost never do in DK cash. And I paid the price, running into the worst of the three QB picks. And that was the difference in the week on DK.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 18 (Jan 6, 2025 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-18-3_df597acd_2024.html: MY WANT PLAYS * Regular readers know I’m typically trying to spend as little as possible at tight end. So while Trey McBride ($6500) and Brock Bowers ($6600) were fine plays, I didn’t think they fit the context of the slate. When Hunter Henry was ruled out I did try to get to Austin Hooper ($3300), but I didn’t think he was worth blowing up my team for. We expected Drake Maye to get pulled early, leaving unproven Joe Milton at QB – and it’s not like Austin Hooper is some great talent.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 18 (Jan 6, 2025 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-18-3_df597acd_2024.html: So I was fine to just punt it off with Peyton Hendershot at minimum $2500, who we projected to have the tight end job to himself for the Chiefs. Hendershot of course isn’t very good, but he did catch 136 balls in four seasons at Indiana from 2018-21. And by spending the minimum at the tight end position, we can win when the entire position fails – which is always a possibility at tight end.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 17 (Dec 29, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-17-3_9959446c_2024.html: * Regular readers know I’m typically trying to spend as little at tight end as possible. That was especially true on this slate, as the other options all had holes. Chig Okonkwo had popped up as a garbage-time merchant, Jake Ferguson’s routes were down in Week 16, and TJ Hockenson was a bit pricy at $4500.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 17 (Dec 29, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-17-3_9959446c_2024.html: So I was fine to punt it off with Payne Durham , who ran 88% of the routes with Cade Otton out in Week 16. Durham was also a reliable pass-catcher at Purdue, and he was facing the Panthers here. So much of tight end scoring is tied up in touchdowns, so getting one at $2900 for a team likely to be among the slate leaders in TDs was nice.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 16 (Dec 23, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-16-2_28f00192_2024.html: * I didn’t think Brenton Strange was the best play in the world. We only had Mac Jones for 32.3 pass attempts here, and Strange’s yards per target expectation is just as poor as Evan Engram’s was. However, given the context of the slate I thought Strange was a must. When we have a viable $3500 tight end and three extremely strong RBs to jam in, I try not to question it. The tight end position floor/ceiling combos are simply too weak to spend up in these contexts.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 16 (Dec 23, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-16-2_28f00192_2024.html: As for FanDuel, I was happy with the decision not to pay up at tight end (Trey McBride), which allowed me to play Chuba Hubbard over Patrick Taylor. And the decision to consider the Falcons D/ST a must paid off massively.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 13 (Dec 2, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-13-3_a8bf73ad_2024.html: We also had this unique Taysom Hill situation. The Saints are using him as a pass-catching tight end, short-yardage runner, and even thrower of the ball. He’s not the typical tight end play – he actually has a real ceiling.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 13 (Dec 2, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-13-3_a8bf73ad_2024.html: Week 13 Results This was the first time all season I’ve looked back and hated what I played on DraftKings. I’ve had a ton of success in cash over the last decade by simply not paying up for tight end… and on this slate I played two of them at mid-range costs.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 12 (Nov 24, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-12-3_4cb7e148_2024.html: Week 12 Results When Luke Schoonmaker outscored Hunter Henry, I was kicking myself on that last 2v2. How could I possibly pass on a very viable stone minimum priced tight end?? But then Jakobi Meyers went off, making me a winner on that decision.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 11 (Nov 17, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-11-3_a86ffd69_2024.html: * By going down to Jameis, I was able to get off the ultra-thin Davis Allen (who we had for just 6.3 DK points). And by getting off Dolphins D/ST for Jets D/ST , I was able to fit in a tight end who is actually the focal point of his offense in Hunter Henry . Whereas Davis Allen and Dawson Knox were touchdown-or-bust bets, Henry has seen a team-best 18.4% target share on the season.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 10 (Nov 11, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-10-3_2310eb29_2024.html: * I looked lineups with Will Dissly, Juwan Johnson, Taysom Hill , and Cade Otton at TE. In the end, I thought finding the $700 to get to Taysom’s touchdown upside here was worth it. This team had roughly zero NFL-caliber WRs healthy, both backup RBs were out again, and they were home against the Falcons with a reasonable team total. Unlike other cheap tight ends, Taysom had both a receiving role and a rushing role around the goal-line.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 10 (Nov 11, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-10-3_2310eb29_2024.html: Anyway, having conviction on Brock Purdy made a big difference here. As did not spending up (as usual) at tight end for Dalton Kincaid or Cade Otton. But I certainly got lucky on DraftKings, where Kamara should’ve had about 12 more points if he didn’t drop an easy long TD. Given the way the usage played out, perhaps Kamara on both sites was right. Either way, happy to escape from this week with another small win.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 6 (Oct 13, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-6-3_7120002a_2024.html: However, longtime readers know my attitude at tight end in DraftKings cash. The floor/ceiling combo at the position is so weak, I’m always willing to take the cheapest viable option. I didn’t think it was worth a worse play at QB to get up from Cade Otton to Ferguson.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 6 (Oct 13, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-6-3_7120002a_2024.html: WEEK 6 RESULTS On DraftKings, I did well not to overemphasize tight end. And I did well not to get scared off Bijan Robinson. I do think I got a bit unlucky on CeeDee Lamb, as the Cowboys completely faceplanted and CeeDee only had 16.1 points on 14 targets (42% share!). And I did get very lucky with one of Cade Otton’s two catches going for a TD. But playing Tre Tucker in a difficult matchup against the Steelers probably shouldn’t have been under consideration. Last week I IKB-ed my way off Deebo Samuel and it worked. This week I IKB-ed off Diontae/London on DK and it didn’t work.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 5 (Oct 7, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-5-3_aea25aa9_2024.html: MY MUST PLAYS * I would have considered Tucker Kraft a solid play even if everyone was healthy. But the Packers were without Romeo Doubs (personal), Christian Watson (ankle), and Luke Musgrave (ankle)… and they were facing a Rams defense ranked dead last in yards per play allowed. Given the state of the tight end position, I was never passing on this spot for Kraft at $3500.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 3 (Sep 23, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-3-3_bb4b1713_2024.html: DRAFTKINGS ANALYSIS I thought there were two big keys to this slate: Pick the right three RBs out of the six who were in play. And decide if a mid-range tight end was worth the spend.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 3 (Sep 23, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-3-3_bb4b1713_2024.html: * We talked about Chris Olave all week as arguably the best “ Buy Low ” in fantasy. The Saints are running a very concentrated offense under Klint Kubiak, featuring very little WR3, RB2, or TE targets. So if they would continue to be a plus-offense and also play from neutral or behind, Olave was going to get smacked in the face with positive regression. The mere $1000 different between Olave and Rashid Shaheed was not enough.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 3 (Sep 23, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-3-3_bb4b1713_2024.html: * We had no positive values on any tight end this slate. I thought Jake Ferguson was fine at $4500, but he was coming off an MCL injury and was appropriately priced.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 2 (Sep 16, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-2-3_fab8f145_2024.html: * I certainly didn’t love Colby Parkinson . But I expected the entire tight end position to fail this week – we had zero positive values in projection among all TEs on this slate. So it was a no-brainer to just take the cheapest viable option. I thought that was clearly Parkinson ($3100), who would benefit from both Puka Nacua (knee) and Davis Allen (back) being out.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 1 (Sep 9, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-1-2_2a733f11_2024.html: * I hated the TE position on DraftKings this week. The punts like Ja’Tavion Sanders, Mike Gesicki, and Johnny Mundt were very thin with zero ceiling. Guys such as Evan Engram, Dalton Kincaid, and Trey McBride were appropriately priced.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 1 (Sep 9, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-1-2_2a733f11_2024.html: So I decided to close my eyes and pray on Kyle Pitts as the “least bad” option. I knew the floor was poor for a tight end priced at $4600, but at least the ceiling was solid. Pitts was a negative value in our projections , but still our best TE value on this slate.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 18 (Jan 7, 2024 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-18-2_131274d6_2023.html: * I only considered four tight ends: Trey McBride ($6700), Dallas Goedert ($6100), Jake Ferguson ($6000), and Johnny Mundt ($4500). I was going to play a Goedert team if Chrisitan Kirk ($4000) was active.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 15 (Dec 17, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-15-2_65fa60fe_2023.html: * Before the Tyreek Hill news, I was set to play Elijah Moore at WR3 with Falcons D/ST and Dalton Kincaid at TE. The Waddle news forced me to go down to punt TE in Tucker Kraft , up from Moore to Waddle and down from Falcons D to Bears D .
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 15 (Dec 17, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-15-2_65fa60fe_2023.html: I considered Waddle a must (see above), so even if I was a little uncomfortable with Kraft I didn’t really have a choice. I’m almost always willing to play it a bit thinner at tight end, where floor/ceiling combos are so much lower. Kraft, of course, was subbing for Luke Musgrave in an incredible matchup at just $4700. With Dawson Knox back, I didn’t feel overly compelled to jam Kincaid – if Trey McBride was only $5600 that would’ve been a different story.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 14 (Dec 10, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-14-2_bd55895c_2023.html: I played around with lineups including all three QBs. I didn’t think that decision was overly important. In the end, the 2v2 I looked at was Justin Fields and Brevin Jordan vs. Brock Purdy and Isaiah Likely . I thought there was merit to (hopefully) getting all of the 49ers’ touchdowns through Purdy and CMC. I also thought Likely was the best TE play given he’s in the Mark Andrews role, has proven he can win at the NFL level, and was just $3500.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 13 (Dec 3, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-13-2_c9cb0c42_2023.html: * One of the reasons DraftKings pricing has gotten so tight is because of tight end. We rarely get viable tight ends around the $3000 range anymore, let alone at the minimum $2500. So I was never going to pass on a chance to actually play a solid $2500 tight end. Because the floor on (almost) all tight ends is so low and ceilings are muted, we can take risks on salary-savers at the position. With Dalton Schultz (hamstring) out, I expected Brevin Jordan to effectively soak up that entire role. Jordan isn’t very good, but CJ Stroud is a clear talent-maximizer. Note that once Chris Olave (concussion) was ruled in, Jordan at $900 less than Juwan Johnson was a no-brainer for cash.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 12 (Nov 26, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-12-2_727f489a_2023.html: * There were only two options at tight end in my opinion: Trey McBride or Dalton Kincaid . I thought it was incredibly close – McBride’s role is better but Kincaid’s matchup + game environment was better. In the end, I decided to go with the better quarterback and get some exposure to the Bills side in an excellent pass-game matchup for them.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 11 (Nov 19, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-11-2_9c99421d_2023.html: * The Trey McBride role is well established at this point as one of the best in the NFL. He was also part of of the slate’s best game environment. So while I was tempted by my old XFL friend Donald Parham ($5100) with Gerald Everett sidelined, I was never passing on McBride at $5900 in this spot. Cardinals QBs came into the game targeting tight ends on a massive 30.7% of their throws.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 9 (Nov 5, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-9-2_9643345e_2023.html: * Tight end was a really important decision. There were five below $6000 I thought were really close/solid: Jake Ferguson, Kyle Pitts (no Drake London, QB change), Dalton Schultz, David Njoku, and Dallas Goedert . Schultz was our top value in projections and top tight end on Top Plays . But I preferred Goedert as the better talent and better QB play – and the $4000 didn’t get me anything I wanted.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 9 (Nov 5, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-9-2_9643345e_2023.html: Week 9 Results I continue to struggle with 1v1s this season. Although I did get Jalen Hurts over Lamar Jackson right, Jahan Dotson got smoked by Tank Dell. And Dallas Goedert got hurt, but he was still unlikely to beat the cheaper Dalton Schultz or Jake Ferguson. On a slate so many tight ends hit, the Goedert relative dud hurt.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 6 (Oct 15, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-6-2_12c0d3b1_2023.html: * I liked a bunch of tight ends this week, but thought they were all slightly overpriced: Jonnu Smith ($3400), Kyle Pitts ($3500), Logan Thomas ($3500), and Evan Engram ($4500) all had merit. Note that there was a clear 2v2 on this team – down from Justin Fields to Joe Burrow, up from Logan Thomas to Evan Engram. That was a very close call. In the end I thought Washington’s absurd throw rate combined with Thomas’ very strong role was right.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 5 (Oct 8, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-5-2_1447fa3c_2023.html: MY WANT PLAYS * I thought there were six QBs in play for cash on a slate that only had 20 QBs: Josh Dobbs, Matthew Stafford, Anthony Richardson, Tua Tagovailoa, Jalen Hurts, Patrick Mahomes. I really would’ve been fine with any of them at cost as QB gets deprioritized a bit in DK cash given current pricing conditions. The last 3v3 I looked at was Anthony Richardson , Tyler Boyd , and Travis Kelce vs. Patrick Mahomes, Ja’Marr Chase and Jonnu Smith. Our projections had that roughly equal. I went back and forth a bunch in the final 20 minutes before lock. In the end, I decided that getting access to the week’s best game environment while also (hopefully) dominating my opponents at tight end was worth it.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 4 (Oct 1, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-4-2_fc4b8140_2023.html: Week 4 Results I think the final 3v3 I discussed above was a mistake. Mostly because Zack Moss simply wasn’t that strong of a play with Anthony Richardson under center. And because there was a true stone minimum tight end (Tanner Hudson), and I didn’t play him. I don’t care about the Browns vs. Panthers D/ST thing, but the Richardson side would’ve forced me onto Panthers which would have yielded better results.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 3 (Sep 24, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-3-2_166efcd0_2023.html: * Regular readers know I’m typically trying to spend as little at tight end, because the entire position (outside of Travis Kelce) fails so often. This week I thought Durham Smythe , Dalton Kincaid, and Zach Ertz were the strongest options.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 17 (Jan 1, 2023 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-17_6932d3d0_2022.html: Week 17 Results I think I did a lot of things well this week: * Getting off the Jacksonville guys was right considering their playing time turned out to indeed be a bit fragile. * Brian Robinson getting 18 first-half carries and 24 total carries against the Browns was strong at $5200 – meanwhile Tyler Allgeier lost 9 carries and eight targets to Cordarrelle Patterson. * Tom Brady threw 45 passes with Cade Otton has his TE – meanwhile Nick Foles/Sam Ehlinger combined to throw just 27 passes. * I got great a result from being willing to lean into D/ST uncertainty with the Saints. However, I played Justin Jefferson over Christian McCaffrey. And I’m honestly not sure that was a mistake. But regardless, I simply can’t win when I’m on the wrong side there by 31 points. It continues a frustrating stretch for me where my most expensive players are failing.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 14 (Dec 11, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-14_7847c1d8_2022.html: In hindsight, perhaps my hesitance on Chig was silly given it’s tight end and they all have extremely low floors anyway. And although I don’t see many viable ways to get off Philip Dorsett, perhaps I should have made that a priority. But overall I’m happy with the team, especially sticking to Jared Goff, and not playing D’Andre Swift (he was 28% in double up).
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 13 (Dec 4, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-13_cfb9a617_2022.html: * It was going to be hard to get really hurt at tight end this week. Travis Kelce did not fit any realistic builds up at $7900, and Mark Andrews’ game environment was awful. So I was thrilled to just completely punt it off at just $2700 with Harrison Bryant . David Njoku (knee) was out and the Texans are among the league’s worst defenses. Even if Bryant faceplanted, I didn’t think any of the guys in the $3K or $4K range would bury me.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 12 (Nov 27, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-12_5be72500_2022.html: So I really liked both Perine and Andrews, and therefore really struggled with this 2v2. Honestly didn’t know which way to go. In the end, I thought the floor/ceiling combo of Adams was worth going for. In these close calls I typically lean into paying down at tight end.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 10 (Nov 14, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-10-2_41fd70d9_2022.html: * I knew I was playing one of Greg Dulcich or Foster Moreau at tight end. I preferred Dulcich as the more athletic player who sees his targets further down the field. Ever since coming off IR a month ago, Dulcich has had elite usage for a tight end – especially one priced at just $3400.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 10 (Nov 14, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-10-2_41fd70d9_2022.html: That said, Moreau was also extremely solid at just $3200. Darren Waller and Hunter Renfrow both out, and Moreau running a route on roughly 100% of the Derek Carr dropbacks. So it created a unique situation where we had two strong punt tight ends, some very expensive players I wanted to play (see below), and a bunch of “meh” in the mid-range. I give up some ceiling by going tight end in flex, but the floor of something like Moreau vs. Mack Hollins or Marquez Valdes-Scantling isn’t much different.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 10 (Nov 14, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-10-2_41fd70d9_2022.html: * At $9100, Tyreek Hill certainly wasn’t a steal. But I still thought he was underpriced thanks to an insane role that Mike McDaniel draws up weekly for one of the NFL’s best talents. At any lower price in this matchup, Hill would have been a must. But at $9100, I did look at lineups that had Amon-Ra St. Brown as my WR1. But once I went to the 2-TE set, I wanted my favorite two plays on the slate (Saquon Barkley and Tyreek Hill) on the squad. That’s what 2-TE allows us to do.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 9 (Nov 6, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-9_beb78f9f_2022.html: * Last week , Foster Moreau ran 41 routes on 41 Raider dropbacks with Darren Waller (hamstring) sidelined. Waller was ruled out again Sunday morning, and Moreau was just $3200. This is exactly the kind of spot I’m looking for when punting tight end in cash.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 8 (Oct 30, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-8_e741c8dd_2022.html: This slate did not have Josh Allen, Patrick Mahomes, Lamar Jackson, Joe Burrow, or Justin Herbert. It also did not have any RBs under $6100 or WRs under $5300 I felt comfortable playing. This created a very narrow construction where it was clear punting at both QB and TE was optimal.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 8 (Oct 30, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-8_e741c8dd_2022.html: * Regular readers know I’m typically trying to spend as little as possible at tight end in cash. I was ready to punt it off with Noah Fant at $2800. But once Darren Waller (hamstring) was ruled out, I was going to find the $300 to get to Foster Moreau . We saw Moreau have a very strong role last week when Waller was out, the Saints are a pass-funneling defense, and the game environment had shootout potential. Note that I did prefer Irv Smith to Moreau, but there was no way I could find the $400 to get there.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 7 (Oct 23, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-7_acb1cbca_2022.html: I thought the optimal roster structure for this slate was very obvious. We didn’t have many of fantasy’s best players on this slate: No Josh Allen or Jalen Hurts, no Stef Diggs or Justin Jefferson, and Christian McCaffrey wasn’t in play. That left us with clear pay-down spot at TE and balance everywhere else.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 7 (Oct 23, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-7_acb1cbca_2022.html: As for Otton vs. Moreau, I really thought it was a stone coin flip. In the end, I went Otton because Moreau had been on the injury report this week and it’s a new Raiders staff – we weren’t 100% certain how they would handle Waller’s absence. Meanwhile, the last time Brate was out Otton ran a route on almost every one of Tom Brady’s dropbacks and earned seven targets. Note Otton came into this game with 109 routes run and 16 targets – a very good targets per route run rate for a rookie tight end.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 7 (Oct 23, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-7_acb1cbca_2022.html: * Another extremely close call was DK Metcalf vs. Tee Higgins vs. Chris Godwin. I really struggled with this one. In the end, I decided I didn’t want to take on the systemic risk of three Seahawks in cash. As for Tee vs. Godwin, I really liked both a lot. Once I decided to go Otton at tight end for Bucs exposure, I wanted to get some exposure to this excellent spot for the Bengals pass game. So I went with Higgins, leaving $300 on the table in this lineup in the process.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 6 (Oct 18, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-6_d0a178f1_2022.html: * Tight end was one of the slate’s biggest decision points. I did not have much desire to play a $4600 Tyler Higbee in a likely sluggish game. That meant either paying up for Mark Andrews at $7000 or going with a low-ceiling punt.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 6 (Oct 18, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-6_d0a178f1_2022.html: Although Stef Diggs was $1400 more than Andrews, I preferred Diggs. And there were no builds I could find that played both. So that left me punting at tight end and saving the $3500+ that comes with that. I thought there were plenty of reasonable options: Zach Gentry playing the Pat Freiermuth role. Hunter Henry with Jonnu Smith (ankle) in doubt. Irv Smith at just $3200, Hayden Hurst , Dawson Knox in a good game environment, Robert Tonyan.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 5 (Oct 9, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-5_c6ef5a4e_2022.html: * There were a lot of viable punts at tight end this week. Cade Otton, OJ Howard, Irv Smith, Dalton Schultz, Hunter Henry were among the viable very cheap options. But going down to them didn’t get me any upgrades I thought were warranted, and Tyler Higbee ’s target projection at $4300 was really strong. The Rams clearly scheme first-read plays to Higbee.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 4 (Oct 3, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-4_f67c2e2c_2022.html: This was a very shallow slate. In cash, I only seriously considered two QBs, one TE, four RBs, and six WRs. That is a very, very small pool of players to pick through. Of course, when the pool is this small it is relatively easy to land on a team.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 4 (Oct 3, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-4_f67c2e2c_2022.html: * I couldn’t find any “punt” tight ends I liked. Travis Kelce wasn’t on the slate. And we detailed on Establish The Show why this was a spot for Lamar Jackson/Mark Andrews regression. So I never really considered any tight end other than TJ Hockenson . With D’Andre Swift, Amon-Ra St. Brown, and DJ Chark all out, there was a ton of target opportunity to go around. Hockenson was also in a dome facing arguably the NFL’s worst defense, as Matt Davidow noted on the betting show Friday night .
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 3 (Sep 16, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-3_9faa9f95_2022.html: I do think that avoiding the temptation of double-TE (Juwan Johnson and Irv Smith) was right. I just don’t want two zero-ceiling players in my lineup. And I also think that being willing to take a cheap shot on a guy in Hollins who was going to play a ton and had some extra target room in a very good matchup was sharp.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 2 (Sep 19, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-2_489bfeb9_2022.html: * This was a pretty easy slate at tight end. The lineups I wanted to play had to save money at tight end, and Travis Kelce wasn’t on the slate anyway. Mark Andrews or Darren Waller would have been nice, but the RBs and WRs I wanted to play at that range were stronger.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 2 (Sep 19, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-2_489bfeb9_2022.html: So I only really considered three tight ends: Juwan Johnson, Kylen Granson , and Albert Okwuegbunam. And I didn’t feel the need to spend an extra $1200 on Albert O after the Broncos threw the ball to four different tight ends in Week 1.

- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 18 (Jan 4, 2026 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-18-4_eabd1d2c_2025.html: MY WANT PLAYS * The Vikings D/ST has been one of the best, and most aggressive, in the entire NFL over the second half of the year. Now they got a home game against a Packers team resting all their starters, and using third-stringer Clayton Tune at QB. The only reason Vikings at $3000 weren’t a lock was because the Broncos ($3800) were an excellent play against the Chargers backups.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 16 (Dec 22, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-16-3_0d1b3f5b_2025.html: MY WANT PLAYS * I preferred the Bengals (against Quinn Ewers) or Giants (against JJ McCarthy) as a punt. But as always at D/ST, I’m ideally paying as little as possible. That left the Jets D/ST at just $2100 against Tyler Shough.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 15 (Dec 14, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-15-3_bb0dd5d5_2025.html: So getting to Lawrence for $500 more wasn’t possible unless I punted D/ST with the Raiders, which I thought about but ultimately didn’t want to do.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 14 (Dec 7, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-14-5_3ecf734d_2025.html: * I had this team in on Friday, except with Trevor Lawrence and Commanders D/ST. I still had that same team in on Sunday morning. I hate to get blown off a team that I really like by weather FUD, which is almost always overrated. But I didn’t think I was really downgrading by going to Jayden Daniels and Saints D/ST . Obviously the matchup for Daniels was difficult, but his unique dual threat ability at just $6000 was crazy cheap. He also had a fresh Terry McLaurin and was playing in a dome. So I was happy to keep this team I really liked, by only coming off QB and downgrading at the extremely volatile D/ST position. Once superstar LT Tristan Wirfs was ruled out for the Bucs, I was fine playing the Saints.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 13 (Nov 30, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-13-4_36238941_2025.html: * The only two D/STs I considered were the punts: Titans against Trevor Lawrence, or Jets D/ST against Kirk Cousins. I preferred Jets as Cousins is more likely to generate strip sacks and pick-6s, but I was always going to play whatever fit.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 12 (Nov 24, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-12-4_243a596c_2025.html: * I certainly liked defenses such as Seahawks, Ravens, Packers, Raiders. But on a tight slate, I needed to save money and we had two great options: Saints against the crust of Kirk Cousins, or Browns excellent pass rush against Geno Smith and a Raiders OL ranked 31st in Brandon Thorn’s latest. This lineup had the $400 to get to Browns D/ST .
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 11 (Nov 17, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-11-4_f8a100f7_2025.html: * No-brainer spot to pay down at D/ST here. We had Jeffrey Simmons back for the Titans D and they were at home against Davis Mills. A classic “close your eyes and be glad you’re only paying $2300 for defense” play.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 10 (Nov 10, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-10-4_cba6f8ca_2025.html: Week 10 Results I lost the 2v2 of Brissett/Browns vs. McCarthy/Jaguars by 1.3 points, which cost me some head-to-heads. That’s frustrating because the Jets D/ST flukily scored two special teams TDs in the first half. Of course, playing McBride on both sites separated me from the pack. I was also happy with the decision to go to the Brissett/Browns side as it was contrarian and I think it had higher floor. When I have a contrarian cash team with a stack, I try to always put it in a GPP — this team finished 76th out of 1,721 entries in the $150 3-max.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 9 (Nov 2, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-9-4_dccd2f62_2025.html: * I would’ve loved to play Chargers (Cam Ward) or Rams (Tyler Shough) at D/ST. But I knew I wouldn’t be able to spend that much at the ever-volatile D/ST spot. So I really only looked at punting with Giants ($2400) or Falcons ($2500). My gut was to prefer Giants, but we triple-checked our Falcons projection and felt good about having them decently ahead. Drake Maye’s sack rate is quietly sky high. Shout out to projections team (again).
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 9 (Nov 2, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-9-4_dccd2f62_2025.html: Week 9 Results Devin Singletary played exponentially more than I thought he would, making the Tyrone Tracy over TreVeyon Henderson play look really bad. Luckily Henderson didn’t bury me. On the good side, our projection on Falcons D/ST over Giants D/ST made a big difference. I think the DK team was rock solid, I would play some version of that every time on this slate. On FanDuel, not playing Caleb Williams at just $7300 was probably a mistake. Especially since I didn’t love playing Brian Thomas Jr. in cash, and I thought the Bills would play well.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 8 (Oct 27, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-8-3_7584ccf3_2025.html: * I thought the Bengals were the best “punt” D/ST. I would’ve been fine with Giants $2100, Saints $2300, or Ravens $2800. But given the slate context, getting to the elite ones like Bills, Falcons, Patriots, Colts was not something I wanted to do. Justin Fields’ sack rate and the overall dysfunction of the Jets made me actually like getting to CIN at $2700.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 8 (Oct 27, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-8-3_7584ccf3_2025.html: So I blew up the team I had in. I went from Tyler Huntley, Jonathan Taylor, Jaylin Noel, Saints D/ST to Bo Nix, Rachaad White, Darnell Mooney, and Bengals D/ST. We had the Mooney side well ahead in projection, but I did think the access to Taylor’s absurd ceiling made it close. In the end, I was worried Noel would lose too many routes to Braxton Berrios, and passing on Mooney at $4400 wasn’t ideal.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 7 (Oct 19, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-7-4_01bceb8a_2025.html: * Justin Fields’ outrageous sack rate combined with Garrett Wilson’s absence made the Panthers D/ST an easy punt at just $2500. If I had more money I would’ve been fine with Patriots, Broncos, or Chiefs. But as usual, I try to spend as little as realistically viable at D/ST and Panthers were our second-best salary-adjusted value .
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 6 (Oct 12, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-6-4_1a7f9202_2025.html: * As usual, I was looking to spend as little as possible at D/ST. The Dolphins were facing the Chargers injury-decimated offensive line at home at just $2200. The Titans against mistake-prone Geno Smith and the Raiders’ brutal offensive line was also an option at $2400, but didn’t fit this team.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 5 (Oct 7, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-5-4_6bacf558_2025.html: * The Saints D/ST was a home favorite against a rookie QB operating without his WR1. I wasn’t going to overthink this when they were just $2200. The Saints were easily our best value at the position.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 3 (Sep 21, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-3-4_842647f2_2025.html: MY WANT PLAYS * The last 2v2 I looked at was Jordan Mason and Packers D/ST vs. Jonathan Taylor and Bengals D/ST . I thought the best play in this group of four was clearly JT. He now has the pass-down role, the Titans were without run-plugging DT T’Vondre Sweat, and I expected the Colts to control the game. On the other hand, I didn’t expect Mason to be heavily involved in the pass game and isn’t nearly as explosive as Taylor.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 2 (Sep 15, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-2-4_2ae947ca_2025.html: One of the last 2v2s I looked at was Justin Fields/Saints D/ST vs. Drake Maye/ Rams D/ST . I thought that was very close, but we did have Rams D a massive 2.8 points clear of Saints. And Rams DL vs. Titans OL, which was without JC Latham, was one of Brandon Thorn’s mismatches of Week 2. And Cam Ward, a rookie, is going to be mistake prone.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 1 (Sep 8, 2025 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-1-3_2facc129_2025.html: * I thought Steelers D/ST ($3300) was clearly the best defense on the slate, given Justin Fields’ sack rate and mistake-prone style. That said, we know in cash that paying as little as possible for D/ST is often right. The ceilings aren’t high, and every unit has the same floor. I would’ve also been fine with the underrated Seahawks ($2500) or the elite pass rush of the Giants ($2300). On FanDuel, saving money with the Rams against the Texans’ hapless OL an easy click. Our Brandon Thorn had Steelers>Jets as his No. 1 OL/DL mismatch , and Rams>Texans was No. 2.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 18 (Jan 6, 2025 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-18-3_df597acd_2024.html: * I would have been fine with a ton of D/STs on this slate. Bucs (vs. Rattler), Broncos (vs. Wentz), Texans (at Levis), Commanders (at Lance) were some of my favorites. I simply played the one that fit, which in this lineup was the Texans D/ST . If I could’ve gotten to Austin Hooper over Peyton Hendershot by going down to Giants D/ST against Tanner McKee, I likely would have.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 14 (Dec 8, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-14-3_b95658ea_2024.html: So after I got off Last Minute Livestream , I had to quickly look at a 3v3 of Jerry Jeudy, Jakobi Meyers, and Jaguars D/ST vs. Justin Jefferson , Calvin Austin , and Saints D/ST . We had it almost even in projection . I did not have a strong feeling either way. I decided to go with the Jefferson side for four reasons. First, I thought the Falcons’ inability to generate pressure would lead to a big Sam Darnold game. He is very pressure sensitive. Second, I knew I had Jeudy and Jakobi in cash on FanDuel (see team above), leaving me with a natural hedge across sites. Third, I thought Saints D/ST was significantly better than Jaguars D/ST. And finally, I was mostly playing head-to-heads – stacking Darnold and Jefferson would lead to more outcomes where I sweep the board. Unlike Double Ups or 50/50s, having a 95% percentile lineup in head-to-heads means a ton.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 13 (Dec 2, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-13-3_a8bf73ad_2024.html: * There were not a lot of strong D/ST options on this slate. I would’ve been willing to play almost any one that fit the team I liked, all the way down to Panthers at $2300. That said, I did want to attack this Patriots offensive line and rookie Drake Maye for $500 more than minimum. We had Colts ($2800) and Jets ($2500) as the two best salary-adjusted D/ST plays on the slate in projections.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 12 (Nov 24, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-12-3_4cb7e148_2024.html: But in order to get that extra money, I needed to come off Bucs D/ST. I wouldn’t have done that if there weren’t two other truly elite options. Dolphins at home against Drake Maye and the inept Patriots OL, and Broncos against Gardner Minshew. I decided I was fine with any of those three defenses, and would play whichever one fit.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 10 (Nov 11, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-10-3_2310eb29_2024.html: MY MUST PLAYS * The Bears D/ST was home against the Patriots at just $3000. Note that they were $5000 (near the max) on FanDuel. The only sub-$3K option on DraftKings I thought was in play was the Patriots, but I did not want to show up without Bears here. The Pats checked in with the NFL’s No. 32 offensive line in Brandon Thorn’s midseason rankings .
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 9 (Nov 4, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-9-3_15a92484_2024.html: * The big decision came down to Dak Prescott, CeeDee Lamb, and Giants D/ST vs. Jayden Daniels , Drake London , and Titans D/ST . I know the Dak/CeeDee side felt better, but I was pretty adamant about not playing both Dak and CeeDee in cash here.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 9 (Nov 4, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-9-3_15a92484_2024.html: Week 9 Results I was really happy with the way I handled Dak-CeeDee stuff on DraftKings. But when you lose Drake London plus Chris Olave to injuries, it’s going to be very hard to have a big day. I’m thrilled just to book a small win. As for FanDuel, the late news on Ekeler pulled me off a Kamara team which is frustrating. I think not playing Kamara just to get to CeeDee Lamb was probably a mistake. I also think Commanders D/ST over Bengals D/ST was a mistake as well – Bengals at home against Gardner Minshew is probably a better spot than Commanders on road against Daniel Jones, even with Andrew Thomas out. The other 1v1 I got wrong on FD was Calvin Ridley over Jakobi Meyers. That one was really tough, I decided to go for the big play upside of Ridley but I could certainly make a case the matchup/environment was much better for Meyers.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 7 (Oct 20, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-7-3_f919d58d_2024.html: * As for D/ST on DraftKings, I wanted to play one of Rams ($3000), Colts ($3200), Bengals ($3300), or Bills ($3400). Unfortunately, it was very tough to pay up for D/ST on this slate. So I settled for the Browns , who were at home against a Bengals team which drops Joe Burrow back a ton. Note that I would’ve played Giants D/ST on DraftKings if I didn’t already have them on FanDuel. Brian Burns + Dexter Lawrence were healthy and the Eagles were without LT Jordan Mailata (hamstring).
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 6 (Oct 13, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-6-3_7120002a_2024.html: * I rarely consider a D/ST a must. But given the tight pricing on this slate and the other sub-$3K options, the Bucs D/ST was certainly a standout. I did prefer Eagles, Texans, and Steelers over Bucs, but they were all at least $800 more. I did not consider any D/STs under $2600, and was more than fine with Bucs against Round 5 rookie Spencer Rattler making his first career start behind a banged up offensive line.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 5 (Oct 7, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-5-3_aea25aa9_2024.html: * The Broncos D/ST was at home facing Gardner Minshew, who would be without Davante Adams. I didn’t think they were a lock at $2900, as the Patriots ($2900), Commanders ($3000), and Sehawks ($3500) were all strong as well. But I was fine leaning into the very aggressive Broncos defense in this spot.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 5 (Oct 7, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-5-3_aea25aa9_2024.html: Obviously, getting a touchdown and huge game from Broncos D/ST helped a ton. As did Tucker Kraft’s eruption.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 4 (Sep 30, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-4-3_35bd5775_2024.html: * When the week started, I wanted to play the Raiders D/ST against a broken Browns offense missing both their tackles and standout RG Wyatt Teller. But then the Raiders lost all-world sack-artist Maxx Crosby and their best offensive player, Davante Adams.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 4 (Sep 30, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-4-3_35bd5775_2024.html: So the three D/STs I was willing to play in cash were Steelers ($3300), Texans ($3000), and Falcons ($2600). I’m rarely/never going to change my team around for D/ST, I’m always willing to take the cheapest viable option.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 4 (Sep 30, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-4-3_35bd5775_2024.html: Week 4 Results I got extremely lucky to run into two D/ST touchdowns from the Falcons. I got extremely unlucky to lose Rashee Rice midway through the first quarter, and take an airball. Of course luck is going to play a major role in a 1-slate sample, that’s why it’s so important to focus on process and game selection.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 2 (Sep 16, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-2-3_fab8f145_2024.html: * I wanted to play one of Broncos , Patriots, Jaguars, or Chargers at D/ST. I also would’ve been fine with Commanders or Giants. This lineup had exactly $2800 left, so the choice was between Broncos and Patriots. Obviously, the Seahawks projected for more dropbacks which is normally how I break coin-flips at D/ST. But I did think if the Broncos could get a lead (they were only 2.5-point dogs), Justin Fields’ mistake-prone nature would lead to a bigger ceiling. Broncos also gave me some late-swap options if I needed.

I considered it, but in the end considered Anthony Richardson a must. And I was more than fine with White at this depressed price given his pass-catching plus goal-line role in a very good matchup.

I liked Falcons ($3300) and Chargers ($2900) most relative to cost, but if I had to punt with something like Patriots or Broncos or Commanders or even Panthers… I could’ve lived with that. As it turned out, Chargers fit perfectly with the team I had.

There were so many backup QBs starting that it because easy to find a cheap one. My favorite was the Raiders ($3700) against Jarrett Stidham, but this lineup only had enough money for Chargers ($3300) against Blaine Gabbert.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 18 (Jan 7, 2024 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-18-2_131274d6_2023.html: Note that one reason the Chargers D/ST projected so well is because we still had a high projected pass rate on the Chiefs. In the past, Andy Reid has not changed his offensive philosophy in these spots. And of course, the best way to generate D/ST points is through outsized quantity of dropbacks from bad QBs.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 16 (Dec 25, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-16_7712239d_2023.html: MY WANT PLAYS * I am totally fine punting D/ST on DraftKings. It’s a smaller portion of our score (on average) and the savings go further. But on FanDuel, I’m typically looking to spend up for a really strong option. However, on this slate, there simply wasn’t a strong enough expensive D/ST and not enough savings on the rest of the slate to pay up. I only considered Seahawks ($3500) against Ryan Tannehill or Commanders ($3800) against Trevor Siemian. If I had unlimited money, I would’ve played Browns ($4800) against Case Keenum or Jets ($5000) against Sam Howell.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 16 (Dec 25, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-16_7712239d_2023.html: Week 16 Results Losing Dontayvion Wicks to a chest injury soon after his touchdown wasn’t ideal. But I ran hot on Evan Engram soundly beating Trey McBride and Seahawks D/ST beating Commanders D/ST.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 15 (Dec 17, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-15-2_65fa60fe_2023.html: As for D/ST, Bears have been one of the NFL’s better units over the last month. Against statue-esque Joe Flacco in a bit of weather, I was fine with it. Not excited, but fine. Flacco has a long history of pick-6s, and we know the Browns are willing to drop him back a ton of times.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 14 (Dec 10, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-14-2_bd55895c_2023.html: * The Browns D/ST was going to be a stone-cold lock if CJ Beathard started. But even with Trevor Lawrence starting, I thought Browns D/ST was the best play at $3000 or below. The Jaguars were down to their 3rd-string left tackle, Lawrence couldn’t walk just five days ago, Christian Kirk was out, and the Browns have one of the best defenses in the entire league.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 13 (Dec 3, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-13-2_c9cb0c42_2023.html: * The final 2v2 was Diontae Johnson + Falcons D/ST vs. Josh Downs + Colts D/ST. I certainly preferred Downs to Diontae as the more explosive player in a better game environment. And normally I wouldn’t worry about D/ST, I’d simply take the position player I like better and let the chips fall at defense. But in this case, Diontae’s clean matchup against the Cardinals and the wild ineptitude of Jets OL plus “Tim Boyle” was too much to ignore. I thought it was a coinflip so I went with the projections, which had the Diontae/ATL side 1.9 points ahead.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 12 (Nov 26, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-12-2_727f489a_2023.html: This was only a 10-game slate due to Thanksgiving plus the Friday game. It created a tighter player pool – I only considered 1 QB, 5 RBs, 7 WRs, 2 TEs, and 3 D/STs. When I have a tight pool like that, I typically feel good about construction. I just need to get the close calls right.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 12 (Nov 26, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-12-2_727f489a_2023.html: * D/ST is always a priority for me on FanDuel given the scoring system. I did not want to “punt” with something like Texans ($3300), Cardinals ($3500), or Rams ($3600). I thought the choices were Patriots ($4500) against sack-happy Tommy Devito, Titans ($4300) against league-worst Bryce Young, or Broncos ($4100) home against DTR.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 12 (Nov 26, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-12-2_727f489a_2023.html: Week 12 Main Slate Results As expected when I have a tight player pool, I feel really good about the team I played. I also got a bit lucky as Zack Moss played far more than I thought he would. And Jalen Hurts + Nico Collins both exploded very late in their games. But the decision not to force AJ Brown or Cooper Kupp, and to pay up at D/ST, made all the difference.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 10 (Nov 12, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-10_446ac3b4_2023.html: MY MUST PLAYS * I almost never consider a D/ST a must. But on FanDuel, it is such a big decision weekly. That’s because there are no 300- or 100-yard bonuses, and it’s half-PPR. But D/ST scoring is the same as DraftKings. The D/STs are also clumped closer together in terms of pricing on FD. So with all that said, I thought playing the Cowboys D against Tommy DeVito was a must. Especially since Dallas has one of the league’s best pass rushes and was facing Brandon Thorn’s No. 26 offensive line .
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 10 (Nov 12, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-10_446ac3b4_2023.html: To be clear, I only late swap in head-to-heads when I know for certain I am buried and likely blocked as well. The swap I made was Geno Smith, Bijan Robinson, Marquise Brown, and Cowboys D into Dak Prescott, Kenneth Walker, Brandin Cooks, and Seahawks D/ST. This gave me two sets of two correlated pieces to try to come back and get lucky. And I did. Here’s what it looked like:
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 9 (Nov 5, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-9-2_9643345e_2023.html: MY WANT PLAYS * This was an incredibly strong slate for D/ST. And it’s very important to get D/ST right on FanDuel. I really only considered three: Patriots ($3700) against Sack Howell, Packers ($3800) against Brett Rypien, and Browns ($4700) against Clayton Tune. I did consider going up to the Browns and sacrificing at tight end. But the Patriots were so strong as well, that I was fine taking the savings.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 8 (Oct 29, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-8-2_36af805e_2023.html: * I am far more willing to spend up at D/ST on FanDuel. Eagles, Cowboys, Ravens, Chiefs were all in the $4500-$5000 range and in play. But we also had Falcons against Will Levis and Vikings against Jordan Love, both below $4000. I was prepared to play any of those defenses that fit, and the Falcons fit here.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 7 (Oct 22, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-7-2_3ec6ec03_2023.html: * I almost never call a D/ST a “must,” but we had a perfect storm this week. The Giants were the fourth-cheapest defense on the entire slate at $3400 and facing Sam Howell who was on pace to shatter the NFL record for sacks taken. This game was also at home for the Giants, making it a bit more likely they could get a lead and force Howell into a ton of dropbacks.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 6 (Oct 15, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-6-2_12c0d3b1_2023.html: * Obviously the 49ers, Eagles, and Dolphins defenses were all in excellent spots. But in cash, I am always trying to spend as little as possible at this spot. It’s difficult to get truly burned unless the expensive D/ST scores a touchdown, which is not predictable at all. I really only considered Bucs ($2300) and Lions ($2700) here, but would’ve been fine with Browns ($2200), Cardinals ($2400) or Bears ($2500) as well.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 5 (Oct 8, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-5-2_1447fa3c_2023.html: * As always, I was trying to spend as little as possible at D/ST. I would have been fine with any of Panthers, Titans , Cardinals under $3000. Titans fit here.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 4 (Oct 1, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-4-2_fc4b8140_2023.html: * Regular readers know I’m trying to spend as little as possible at D/ST. This week, I thought the cheapest viable defense was Panthers ($2500) at home against Kirk Cousins who projects to be among the league leaders in dropbacks each week. I did prefer the Browns , although after Deshaun Watson (shoulder) was ruled out they certainly got worse. We want our D/STs to have a lead so the opponent is dropping back a lot in known passing situations. And obviously Ravens ($3200) got better with Dorian Thompson-Robinson starting. My team had room for Browns but not Ravens. I didn’t think leaving money on table for Panthers was right, even with Watson out.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 3 (Sep 24, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-3-2_166efcd0_2023.html: In the end, I didn’t think the use of the $1200 got me enough. In hindsight, using it for Tyreek Hill over Tony Pollard (once Jaylen Waddle was ruled out) may have been correct. I do not think using it to upgrade D/ST would have been correct.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 3 (Sep 24, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-3-2_166efcd0_2023.html: * Obviously I would have loved to play our top D/ST in the Bills at $2900. Or the Jets at $2800. But this lineup only had the money for Commanders, which I was fine with. They had Brandon Thorn’s No. 6 DL>OL mismatch and Josh Allen’s aggression can lead to turnover-laden games.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 3 (Sep 24, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-3-2_166efcd0_2023.html: Week 3 Results Obviously the Bills D/ST scoring 32 DraftKings points was going to be difficult to overcome. It’s such an absurdly huge outlier, and they were around 28% owned in cash. So to emerge from that with a win… I feel fortunate and will definitely take it. And no, this result won’t make more likely to prioritize certain D/STs in cash.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 2 (Sep 19, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-2-2_f6692ae4_2023.html: * There were three D/ST options I considered: Cardinals ($2600), Titans ($2400), or Raiders ($2200). Bucs ($3200) and Cowboys ($4000) were my favorite pay-up options, but I’d rarely spend that much at D/ST in cash. This lineup did not have the $200 to get to the Cardinals, so I went with Titans. If I really needed the $200, I would’ve been OK going down to Raiders.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 1 (Sep 10, 2023 | season 2023) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-1_a52e1275_2023.html: *I’m sure most people considered Commanders D/ST (home vs. Josh Dobbs and the least talented team in the NFL) a “must”. I almost never consider D/ST a must. If there isn’t a D/ST touchdown, it’s almost impossible for them to separate. Obviously, D/ST TDs are extremely rare even when a defense is in the nut spot.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 17 (Jan 1, 2023 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-17_6932d3d0_2022.html: In order to get to Otton on this team however, I had to go from the more explosive Tyler Allgeier to plodder Brian Robinson and from Packers D/ST to Saints D/ST . I was fine with that. Although B-Rob’s pass-game role was a huge concern, I thought 20+ carries against a poor Browns rush defense at $5200 was really strong. Meanwhile, Allgeier had a higher ceiling but was threatened by Cordarrelle Patterson.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 17 (Jan 1, 2023 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-17_6932d3d0_2022.html: And at defense, regular readers know I’m always willing to play the cheapest viable option. Yeah the 49ers were a very strong play, but the random nature of D/ST doesn’t make something like them a “must.” So the Saints against a pocket-passing Gardner Minshew (no Jalen Hurts) without stud tackle Lane Johnson was acceptable to me.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 15 (Dec 18, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-15_9a34f1b6_2022.html: MY WANT PLAYS * It’s D/ST, so Broncos D was not a “must.” But this is a very good defense at home facing Colt McCoy, and they were the 7th-cheapest D/ST on the slate. That’s because the Kyler Murray injury occurred after pricing was released.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 14 (Dec 11, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-14_7847c1d8_2022.html: * There were a lot of close 2v2s I looked at close to lock. The first was Tony Pollard and Greg Dulcich vs. Dalvin Cook and Chig Okonkwo. Another was Tony Pollard and Steelers D/ST vs. Dalvin Cook and Panthers D/ST.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 14 (Dec 11, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-14_7847c1d8_2022.html: The second 2v2 above was tougher. I was more than fine playing Panthers D/ST, regular readers know I’m always willing to play the cheapest viable option. The Panthers also have an above-average pass rush and with Kenneth Walker out, Geno Smith projected to drop back a ton. So it really came down to Pollard vs. Dalvin, and I took it up to the last minute.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 13 (Dec 4, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-13_cfb9a617_2022.html: * As always, I’m looking to play the cheapest viable D/ST in cash. This week, that was the Titans D/ST at just $2200 in Philly. There were some teams that got to Steelers, but I didn’t think it was worth anything at all to get there.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 12 (Nov 27, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-12_5be72500_2022.html: * I rarely consider D/ST a “must.” But the Chiefs D/ST was in Arrowhead against Bryce Perkins with the NFL’s worst offensive line ( per Brandon Thorn) . The Rams also didn’t have Cooper Kupp or Allen Robinson. At just $2800, I was finding the money for KC.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 11 (Nov 20, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-11_3cbe3f5b_2022.html: * The Steelers D/ST was clearly the best “punt” defense on the slate. They had Brandon Thorn’s No. 2 DL>OL mismatch with TJ Watt back. And Joe Burrow is annually among the league leaders in sack rate. At just $2300, this was a no-brainer. If I needed $100 I would have been fine with Colts as well. As always with defense in cash, I’m actively trying to spend as little as possible.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 10 (Nov 14, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-10-2_41fd70d9_2022.html: * The last 3v3 I looked at was Alvin Kamara, Amon-Ra St-Brown and Cardinals D/ST vs. Saquon Barkley , Juju Smith-Schuster , and Packers or Vikings D/ST.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 10 (Nov 14, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-10-2_41fd70d9_2022.html: As for Vikings D/ST vs. Packers D/ST, the Josh Allen elbow injury coupled with far more projected dropbacks led me to leave $200 on the table here and play Minnesota. But that was a stone flip.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 9 (Nov 6, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-9_beb78f9f_2022.html: * The cheap defenses I liked were the Seahawks $2500, Commanders $2400, and Panthers D/ST $2300. In this lineup, I only had enough room for the Panthers. Given Joe Burrow’s absurdly high sack rate and the absence of Ja’Marr Chase, I was fine with it. As usual, I’m just going to play what fits at defense.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 8 (Oct 30, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-8_e741c8dd_2022.html: * The very last 2v2 I looked at was Ken Walker , Cardinals D vs. Dameon Pierce, Texans D. Bottom line was I preferred Walker to Pierce, and wasn’t going to let defense make my decision. D/ST is just way too volatile and unpredictable to sweat it.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 8 (Oct 30, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-8_e741c8dd_2022.html: As for the Cardinals defense – I like playing D/ST in shootouts as it generates more dropbacks aka more chances for sacks, strip sacks, scoop-n-scores, and pick-6s. And the Cardinals have an aggressive defense, even if they aren’t very good. Obviously I would have preferred Commanders (against Sam Ehlinger) or Texans (against Malik Willis) – they were great plays at just $2600. But I simply didn’t have the $100 leftover for it.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 7 (Oct 23, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-7_acb1cbca_2022.html: * The Jets D/ST has Brandon Thorn’s No. 5 overall pass rush and were facing Brett Rypien’s broken Broncos offense in windy conditions. There were no other defenses below $3000 I considered.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 6 (Oct 18, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-6_d0a178f1_2022.html: I really didn’t like spending up at D/ST for a Jaguars unit I didn’t love, but I didn’t have anything to do with the $600. And I did think Jaguars were a better raw play than Panthers, despite all of the Rams offensive line woes.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 5 (Oct 9, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-5_c6ef5a4e_2022.html: * It’s rare I consider a D/ST a “must” in cash. But I’m of course trying to spend as little as possible, and this talented Cowboys unit against the scuffling offensive line of the Rams stuck out. Just $2500 and armed with Brandon Thorn’s 4th-biggest mismatch of the week .
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 3 (Sep 16, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-3_9faa9f95_2022.html: * I was fine with a lot of defenses on this slate. Jaguars (if Justin Herbert was out), Jets, Raiders, Panthers , Seahawks, Falcons were all $2700 or under and in acceptable spots. I got a little worried on the Jaguars once it was clear Herbert had a reasonable chance to play. In this construction, I had enough money to get to Panthers at $2600. If going to Jaguars would have gotten me from Jalen Hurts to Josh Allen, I likely would have done that. But it was $300 short. And we had Panthers as the No. 1 D/ST on the week in both Top Plays and in the value column of our projections . So I felt good about getting to them.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 2 (Sep 19, 2022 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-2_489bfeb9_2022.html: MY MUST PLAYS * I rarely consider a D/ST a “must.” But DraftKings released Week 2 pricing prior to Dak Prescott’s Week 1 Sunday Night Football injury. That meant the Bengals D/ST were $2200 (my preferred cash price range for a defense) against Cooper Rush. Also note that Brandon Thorn had the injury-riddled Cowboys OL ranked 19th this week .

## tiebreakers

- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 18 (Jan 4, 2026 | season 2025) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-18-4_eabd1d2c_2025.html: * Another 1v1 was at the $4200 spot. Jaylen Wright , Jaydon Blue, and Juwan Johnson were all in play. I was going to play Blue, but then got scared off by the Phil Mafah activation. Wright vs. Juwan was another really close call. Again, when it’s close I try to lean toward RB. The Dolphins have raved about Wright, and gave him 24 carries when De’Von Achane left early a month ago.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 13 (Dec 2, 2024 | season 2024) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-13-3_a8bf73ad_2024.html: As for FanDuel, the big decision/result was going down to Sam Darnold from Lamar Jackson. And up to Bijan Robinson from Chuba Hubbard. I thought that was very close call, but the threat of Jonathan Brooks made me lean away from Chuba at the last minute. Nice to get a big result there.
- Levitan’s DFS Cash Lineup Review: Week 17 (Jan 1, 2023 | season 2022) — C:\Users\EricTruett\etr\html\levitans-dfs-cash-lineup-review-week-17_6932d3d0_2022.html: * I thought about Christian McCaffrey vs. Justin Jefferson a bunch. We had CMC ahead in base projection, but Jefferson ahead in ceiling. It was an incredibly close call and in these spots I typically lean RB in cash. But Jefferson’s outrageous ceiling appealed to me. In hindsight, this was perhaps wrong given the RB floors and the matchups.
