## Part I — Cash Game Fundamentals


### General Strategy

Cash is not about being the smartest person in the lobby. It’s about being the person who makes the fewest avoidable mistakes.

That starts with an honest understanding of variance. A good lineup can lose, and a bad lineup can win. If you judge yourself by one week, you’ll end up chasing noise. The goal is a process that wins over hundreds of slates: build for median outcomes, accept that you can’t remove randomness, and don’t “tilt build” after a bad beat.

At a high level, cash strategy is just three things:

1) **Buy volume and role, not stories.** Cash lineups are built on playing time, touches/targets, and stable usage. Narratives are fine as flavor, but they should never override role.
2) **Exploit mispricing.** When pricing lags a role change (injury replacements, depth chart shifts, a player moving into every-down usage), you don’t need to get cute. In cash, those are often the cleanest clicks of the week.
3) **Minimize fragility.** A fragile lineup is one where multiple players can fail without you doing anything “wrong” (rotations, gadget roles, boom-bust archetypes). You can tolerate one thin spot; stacking several is how you donate.

One practical way to keep this grounded is to make every decision answer a simple question: *What has to be true for this player to get there?* If the answer is “he needs a long touchdown,” you’re usually in the wrong neighborhood for cash. If the answer is “he plays almost every snap and gets the ball a lot,” that’s the kind of bet we want.

Quick general strategy checklist:

- Prioritize repeatable volume (snaps, routes, touches, targets).
- Treat role changes from injuries as primary value sources.
- Use matchup as context, not as the foundation.
- Avoid lineups with multiple fragile archetypes.
- Don’t chase last week’s box score; chase this week’s usage.
- Judge decisions by process, not by one-week outcomes.

## Part II — Roster Construction

### Shape of the Slate

Before you pick players, you need to understand what kind of slate you’re on. I think of this as the *shape of the slate*: is pricing **tight** (salary is genuinely scarce), or **loose** (salary is abundant)?

This matters because “tight vs. loose” changes what good decision-making looks like. On a tight slate, you’re usually trying to *avoid multiple weak links*. On a loose slate, you’re usually trying to *spend for real upgrades* and prioritize raw points.

Here are the simplest ways to diagnose it.

**A tight slate** usually looks like this:

- There are very few true salary savers with stable roles (“cheap locks”).
- The mid-range is awkward (often at WR): lots of players who are priced like they’re good, but don’t project like must-plays.
- You can’t build a lineup you like without taking multiple thin spots.
- You find yourself saying “I can punt QB/TE/D… and it still doesn’t really fix the lineup.”

Another way to say it: on a tight slate, the slate is “tight” because there aren’t enough strong punts. If you only have one truly viable punt (or zero), the cap effectively tightens — you have fewer ways to make the expensive stuff work.

**A loose slate** usually looks like this:

- There are multiple credible cheap plays across positions (not perfect, but role-stable).
- You can build multiple reasonable lineups without feeling forced into a stone punt.
- Small upgrades ($500–$1500 type moves) are available and meaningful.
- You can choose to spend at QB/TE (or not) without the rest of the lineup collapsing.

On loose slates, you should be more willing to pay for the player you actually want. If the slate is loose and a small salary bump gets you from “fine” to “significantly better,” that’s often correct in cash.

**A practical test I use:** build three versions of your lineup early in the week.

1) A “jam the best raw points” build (usually RB-heavy).
2) A “balanced” build with no embarrassing punts.
3) A build that spends up at a position you often punt (QB or TE) to see what it costs.

If every version ends with two or three uncomfortable names you’d never click in a vacuum, that’s a tight slate. If all three versions look playable and the differences come down to clean 2v2s, it’s a looser slate.

Quick slate-shape checklist:

- Count the number of *real* salary savers with stable roles (especially at WR/TE).
- If you can’t find any “cheap locks,” assume pricing is tight and plan to accept one thin spot.
- If punting QB/TE/D doesn’t materially improve the lineup, that’s a sign the slate is tight.
- If a modest salary bump buys a clear upgrade at a key slot, the slate is probably loose.
- Run the three-build test (raw-points / balanced / pay-up) before you get attached to specific names.

### Roster Structure

Roster structure is where cash players quietly win weeks. You don’t need to find nine perfect plays. You need to build a lineup that (1) captures the best floors on the slate, (2) uses salary efficiently, and (3) avoids taking unnecessary “fragility” at multiple spots.

The first idea is simple but easy to forget: **the best lineup is not nine independent best plays**. It’s a full roster that fits together. Often the correct decision is not “Player A vs. Player B,” but “Build A vs. Build B.” A two-player swap (a 2v2) can change the entire shape of the lineup.

When you’re comparing builds, think in terms of **replacement cost**. If a cheap player is only slightly worse than the mid-tier at his position but saves meaningful salary, that salary often buys you a much bigger upgrade somewhere else. That’s how “musts” are created in cash: not because a player is the No. 1 projection, but because *he’s the piece that makes the best overall lineup possible*.

Next, be intentional about **where you take your discomfort**. Most slates force one thin spot — maybe you’re punting WR3, maybe you’re paying down at TE, maybe you’re taking a cheap D/ST. That’s fine. The mistake is building a lineup with *three* thin spots because each individual punt felt tolerable.

Site scoring and pricing strongly influence this. On full-PPR sites, it’s usually easier to live in the middle at WR because target volume creates floor, while RBs with pass-game roles become even more valuable. On half-PPR/no-bonus scoring, the gap between “pretty good WR” and “fine cheap WR” often shrinks, which can make it correct to emphasize the positions that separate more.

Finally, keep roster construction mechanical. Make the player pool, then use structure rules to stay disciplined.

Quick roster structure checklist:

- Compare lineups as 2v2s and 3v3s, not just 1v1s.
- Treat “musts” as lineup-structure anchors: they’re the pieces that make the best build work.
- Avoid stacking multiple low-floor punts; accept one thin spot, not several.
- Use site scoring to guide salary allocation (PPR pushes volume; half-PPR compresses WR).
- When a choice is truly close, lean toward the position with the more predictable touch/target floor.


## Part III — Position Chapters

There’s no single “right” way to build a cash lineup, but there *are* repeatable ways each position succeeds and fails. The goal of this section is to make your decisions feel less like guessing and more like buying specific archetypes.


### QB

Quarterback is the most stable position in fantasy *until* it isn’t. Most QBs get similar volume in terms of snaps, but their fantasy scoring paths are not created equal.

In cash, I’m usually prioritizing one of two archetypes:

1) **Dual-threats** who can get you 6–10 points with their legs even in mediocre passing games.
2) **High-volume passers** in fast games who are likely to throw 35+ times with efficient weapons.

The biggest mistake I see in cash is treating quarterback like a pure “value” spot without respecting ceiling. If you punt QB and the slate’s best rushing QB posts a normal game, you can survive. If he posts a ceiling game, you’re immediately playing defense from behind.

That doesn’t mean you blindly pay up every week. It means you’re honest about where separation can come from. If pricing and slate context make the elite dual-threats accessible without destroying the rest of the lineup, I’m usually taking the points.

I also don’t force stacks in cash. Correlation is fine when it fits naturally, but the primary goal is floor. If you can get a great QB without forcing a thin WR or TE, do it. If stacking pushes you onto fragile role-players, pass.

Quick QB checklist for cash:

- Prioritize rushing equity (designed runs, scrambles, goal-line usage).
- Use dropbacks and pace as tiebreakers for pocket passers.
- Prefer competent playcallers and consolidated pass games.
- Don’t force stacks; take correlation only when it’s clean.
- Be willing to pay up when the slate offers true QB separation.


### RB

Running back is the position where cash players should feel the most comfortable — not because there’s no variance, but because workload is more predictable than it is at wide receiver.

Start with **role and opportunity**. Carries are good, but the real cheat codes are (1) **pass-game involvement** and (2) **goal-line access**. A back who can get there in multiple ways is the kind of player who “fails less.”

Next, be ruthless about uncertainty. Rotations, vague coach-speak, and “hot hand” usage are the enemy. In cash, I’ll take a slightly worse matchup if it means I’m buying a back whose snaps, routes, and touches are clear.

Injuries are also where the best cash RB plays come from. When a starter is out and the replacement has a three-down skill set, pricing often can’t keep up. Those are the spots where you don’t outthink it.

Matchup matters, but it’s usually a tiebreaker after role. A good defense can lower efficiency, but it can’t stop a true workhorse from having chances — especially if he’s catching passes.

Quick RB checklist for cash:

- Prioritize snaps + routes first; then worry about matchup.
- Target pass-game roles (routes, targets) — especially on full-PPR sites.
- Prefer backs with goal-line usage or strong TD expectation.
- Avoid ambiguous committees unless the price is truly a punt.
- Use team total and game script as tiebreakers.
- Injury-driven role consolidation is often a “don’t overthink it” spot.


### WR

Wide receiver is where cash lineups usually feel the most uncomfortable. The position is inherently higher variance than running back: a player can run routes all day and still get game-scripted out, covered well, or lose a touchdown to someone else.

So the goal at WR isn’t to “predict the spike week.” It’s to buy **repeatable volume** and avoid the archetypes that fail silently.

Start with **playing time and routes**. A wide receiver cannot score if he isn’t on the field, and “starter” is often a misleading label. In cash, I want every-down players who run real routes in normal personnel, not rotational field-stretchers who need two explosives to matter.

Next, prioritize **targets (and target share)** over highlight-reel ability. Touchdowns and long catches are great, but they’re not the foundation. The foundation is a role that reliably produces 7–10 chances. When you’re deciding between a steady target earner and a low-volume burner, the steady guy is almost always the better cash bet.

Finally, respect offensive context. Quarterback quality and playcalling don’t need to be elite, but they can’t be a disaster. A strong WR role inside a broken passing offense is still fragile — especially if the team is comfortable slowing the game down and hiding the QB.

Most slates will also force you into at least one cheaper WR. That’s fine. But when you punt, do it with a player whose role is boring and bankable: snap share, route participation, and a believable target path. Don’t punt with “maybe he hits a bomb.” Cash punts should be boring.

Quick WR checklist for cash:

- Prefer every-down routes over part-time splash-play roles.
- Prioritize target volume/target share; don’t chase last week’s touchdowns.
- Use quarterback quality and team pass volume as context.
- When punting, choose the cheapest WR who still runs real routes.
- On full-PPR/yardage-bonus scoring, volume and yardage paths matter more than TD dependence.
- Don’t force stacks; correlation is fine when it fits naturally.


### TE

Tight end is the position where “sound process” often looks the least satisfying. That’s because the position is touchdown-driven and the weekly floor is ugly across most of the player pool.

In cash, my default is to **pay down** — but not to punt blindly. I’m trying to buy a tight end who is actually running routes and has a realistic path to 5–7 targets. The cheap tight ends who block, rotate, and need a red-zone coin flip are exactly how you take on unnecessary risk.

There are exceptions. When an elite tight end is functioning like a true WR1 (routes, targets, first-read usage) *and* the slate offers no viable cheap roles, paying up can be correct. You’re not paying for “tight end.” You’re paying for a premium target profile that happens to be listed at TE.

The trap is paying for the TE2/TE3 tier because it *feels* safer. If the role is only marginally better than punts, you’re often just burning salary.

Quick TE checklist for cash:

- Start with routes and snap share; avoid rotational blockers.
- Prefer TEs with real target volume or a clear first-read role.
- Pay down by default; pay up only for WR1-like usage.
- Don’t spend up for “name value” if the role is middling.
- Red-zone usage matters, but targets/roles come first.


### D/ST

Defense is the most volatile position we roster. If you’re trying to “predict touchdowns,” you’re doing it wrong. In cash, the goal is to avoid disaster and let the rest of your lineup carry you.

That usually means **paying down**. The pricing gap between the best and the 10th-best defense rarely matches the gap in expected scoring, and the outcomes are noisy. When the expensive defense doesn’t score a touchdown, you often gained very little.

The best predictors we have are simple: opportunities for sacks and turnovers. We want an opponent who is likely to drop back, has protection issues, and has a quarterback who will make mistakes under pressure. Favorites are helpful because leads create obvious passing situations, but don’t force it — a cheap defense in a clean spot is usually good enough.

Quick D/ST checklist for cash:

- Pay down by default; don’t chase last week’s TD.
- Target sack opportunities: weak OL, high dropbacks, aggressive pass rates.
- Prefer mistake-prone QBs and offenses that can’t protect.
- Use spread/team total as context (favorites get better scripts).
- Don’t let D/ST drive major roster decisions.

## Part IV — Decision Making


### Tie-breakers

- Another 1v1 was at the <salary> spot. Jaylen Wright, Jaydon Blue, and Juwan Johnson were all in play. I was going to play Blue, but then got scared off by the Phil Mafah activation. Wright vs. Juwan was another really close call. Again, when it’s close I try to lean toward RB. The Dolphins have raved about Wright, and gave him 24 carries when De’Von Achane left early a month ago.
- As for FanDuel, the big decision/result was going down to Sam Darnold from Lamar Jackson. And up to Bijan Robinson from Chuba Hubbard. I thought that was very close call, but the threat of Jonathan Brooks made me lean away from Chuba at the last minute. Nice to get a big result there.
- I thought about Christian McCaffrey vs. Justin Jefferson a bunch. We had CMC ahead in base projection, but Jefferson ahead in ceiling. It was an incredibly close call and in these spots I typically lean RB in cash. But Jefferson’s outrageous ceiling appealed to me. In hindsight, this was perhaps wrong given the RB floors and the matchups.
